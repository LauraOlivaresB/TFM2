Abstract
Paclitaxel, a standard chemotherapeutic agent for several types of cancer, including ovarian, breast, and non-small-cell lung 
cancer, causes peripheral neuropathy as an adverse effect in 60–70% of the patients. The utility of combination therapy with 
paclitaxel and goshajinkigan, a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, in managing paclitaxel-induced neuropathy during 
chemotherapy has been explored. Paclitaxel is predominantly metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 to 
produce 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and by CYP3A4 to produce 3 ′-p-hydroxypaclitaxel. In this study, we evaluated the inhibi -
tory or inducing effects of goshajinkigan extract (GJG) and its representative and bioavailable constituents, geniposidic 
acid, plantagoguanidinic acid, paeoniflorin, catalpol, loganin, and neoline, on the metabolism of paclitaxel via CYP2C8 
and CYP3A4 using pooled human liver microsomes and cultured human cryopreserved hepatocytes to provide the drug 
information about the pharmacokinetic interaction of this combination therapy. GJG significantly inhibited the production of 
3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. The half maximal inhibitory 
concentration  (IC50) values of GJG were 4.5 and 7.8 mg/ml, respectively, for 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel 
productions. Neoline inhibited the production of 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel at 50 μM, but not at lower concentrations. Apart 
from neoline, other GJG constituents (at concentrations up to 50 or 10 μM of all test substances) did not exhibit inhibitory 
or inducing effects. Since GJG showed the inhibitory effect on the metabolism of paclitaxel at much higher concentrations 
than those used clinically, it can be concluded that GJG product does not exhibit any pharmacokinetic interaction with 
paclitaxel in clinical practice.

Introduction
Paclitaxel, a tricyclic diterpenoid compound derived 
from the bark and needles of Taxus brevifolia, is a stand-
ard chemotherapeutic agent for several types of cancer, 
including melanoma, ovarian, breast, and lung, bladder, 
and prostate cancers. The National Comprehensive Can-
cer Network guidelines has recommended its use in non-
small-cell lung cancer in patients [1 ]. Similar to other 
chemotherapeutic agents, paclitaxel causes peripheral 
neuropathy as a side effect. The incidence rate is reported 
to be 60–70% among chemotherapy patients, and this side 
effect is a major reason for early termination of paclitaxel 
chemotherapy [2 ]. To manage paclitaxel-induced neu-
ropathy during chemotherapy, combination therapy with 
paclitaxel and Japanese traditional Kampo medicines has 
been explored. A clinical study previously reported that 
about 20% of the patients who have neuropathy under 
the paclitaxel chemotherapy was prevented by the com-
bination therapy with goshajinkigan extract (GJG) prod-
uct [3 ]. Goshajinkigan is a formula of Kampo medicine 
composed of ten crude drugs including the dried root of 
Rehmannia glutinosa (Rehmannia root), the dried root of 
Achyranthes fauriei (Achyranthes root), the dried pulp of 
the pseudocarp of Cornus officinalis (Cornus fruit), the 
dried rhizome of Dioscorea japonica (Dioscorea rhizome), 
the dried seeds of Plantago asiatica (Plantago seed), the 
dried tubers of Alisma orientale (Alisma tuber), the dried 
sclerotia of Wolfiporia cocos (Poria sclerotium), the dried 
root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa (Moutan bark), the dried 
bark of the trunk of Cinnamomum cassia  (Cinnamon 
bark), and the dried roots of Aconitum carmichaeli after 
autoclaved (processed Aconite root). Indications of ethi-
cal GJG product that has been approved by the Medicinal 
Regulatory Agency in Japan are to relieve leg pain, lower 
back pain, numbness, blurred vision in the elderly, pruri-
tus, dysuria, frequent urination and edema [4 , 5]. In animal 
experiments, it is revealed that GJG prevents paclitaxel-
induced neuropathy without impairing anti-tumor activity 
of paclitaxel [6 ], and that the extracts of Plantago seed and 
processed Aconite root, and their ingredients aucubin and 
neoline, respectively, exhibited the preventive effects on 
paclitaxel-induced neuropathy [7 , 8].
The use of traditional herbal medicines continues to 
expand rapidly worldwide, the information on drug inter -
actions between herbal medicines and chemical drugs is 
therefore needed [9 ]. The most well-known drug interac-
tion between herbal medicines and chemical drugs is the 
case of grapefruit juice [10], wherein furanocoumarins 
(the active constituents) inhibit intestinal cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4 and consequently increase the bioavail-
ability of its substrates, such as felodipine, cyclosporine and carbamazepine [11]. St. John’s wort and its con-
stituent hyperforin induce the expression of CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, resulting in reduced 
blood concentrations of the substrates of these CYPs 
[12]. The extracts of tokishakuyakusan, kamishoyosan, 
and keishibukuryogan, the three major Kampo formula-
tions frequently used in gynecology, significantly inhib-
ited CYP3A4 activity at higher concentrations in vitro. 
However, at regular doses, Kampo formulations exhibit 
negligible inhibitory effects, and therefore do not cause 
significant interactions with CYP3A4 substrates [13].
Paclitaxel is metabolized by two different CYPs: CYP2C8 
catalyzes the 6-hydroxylation at the taxane ring of paclitaxel 
to produce 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, and CYP3A4 oxidizes the 
tert-butyl group of the lateral chain in C13 of docetaxel to 
produce 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel [14]. The liver is the major 
metabolic organ, and the fraction of the dose metabolized 
was estimated to be 0.963 based on paclitaxel human absorp-
tion, distribution, metabolism, and excretion data [15, 16]. 
The bioavailability of paclitaxel increases when hepatic 
metabolism by CYP enzymes is inhibited by concomitant 
drug(s). Indeed, a clinical case of drug-drug interaction of 
paclitaxel via CYP inhibition has already been confirmed; 
when pazopanib, an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, 
reduced the clearance of paclitaxel and enhanced the maxi-
mum concentration [17]. Thus, understanding the inhibitory 
or inducing effects of Kampo medicines on CYPs is very 
important in preventing serious drug interactions when used 
in combination with paclitaxel.
In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory and inducing 
effects of GJG and its representative and bioavailable con-
stituents (geniposidic acid, plantagoguanidinic acid, paeoni-
florin, catalpol, loganin, and neoline) on the metabolism of 
paclitaxel in vitro. These six compounds were chosen since 
we detected these compounds at comparatively high concen-
trations in human plasma following oral administration of 
GJG (in submitting). We attempted to provide useful drug 
information about combination therapy with GJG product 
and paclitaxel to prevent peripheral neuropathy during pacli -
taxel chemotherapy.
Materials and methods
Materials
Paclitaxel and rifampicin were purchased from Nippon 
Kayaku (Tokyo, Japan) for the experiments on cytochrome 
inhibition, and from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Industries 
(Osaka, Japan) for the experiments on cytochrome induc-
tion. 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel 
were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, 
USA) and ChromaDex (Santa Ana, CA, USA), respectively. 61 Journal of Natural Medicines (2022) 76:59–67

Geniposidic acid was purchased from ChemFaces (Wuhan, 
China). GJG graded according to the quality standards spec-
ified in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia 17th Edition (JP17) 
[18], plantagoguanidinic acid, paeoniflorin, catalpol, loga-
nin, and neoline were supplied by Tsumura & Co. (Tokyo, 
Japan). GJG was the dried extract of the following prescrip-
tion: Rehmannia root (5 g), Cornus fruit (3 g), Dioscorea 
rhizome (3 g), Alisma tuber (3 g), Poria sclerotium (3 g), 
Moutan bark (3 g), Cinnamon bark (1 g), powdered pro-
cessed Aconite root (1 g), Achyranthes root (3 g), and 
Plantago seed (3 g) [4 ]. All crude drugs were also graded 
according to the quality standards specified in JP17, and the 
fingerprint pattern of GJG was shown in our previous study 
[19]. Pooled human liver microsomes (mixed gender) were 
purchased from Sekisui XenoTech, LLC. (Kansas City, KS, 
USA). n-Butyl p-hydroxybenzoate (BHB), quercetin, and 
niflumic acid were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, 
Japan), Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan), and 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively.
Assay of inhibition of paclitaxel metabolism by GJG 
and its constituents in human liver microsome 
fraction
We used the modified methods reported previously [13]. In 
brief, 10 µl of GJG sample solution, 76 µl of 20 µM pacli-
taxel in 0.15 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.13 M 
EDTA, and 4 µl of human liver microsomes (3 mg/ml diluted 
with phosphate buffer) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C 
for 5 min. Then, 10 µl of 10 mM β-NADPH (Oriental Yeast 
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was added, mixed, and incubated 
at 37 °C for 140 min. The reaction was stopped by add-
ing 100 µl of ethanol containing 40 µM BHB as an inter -
nal standard into the reactant and mixing vigorously. After 
centrifugation (15,000 × g , 7 min), 10 µl of the supernatant 
was analyzed using HPLC–MS/MS (Quattro Premier XE, 
Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mass spectrometer used an 
electrospray ionization source in the positive ion mode with 
multiple reaction monitoring. The analytical column was an 
Inertsil ODS-4 (2.1 mm i.d. × 100 mm, 3 µm) (GL Sciences 
Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase was delivered using 
a linear gradient elution system consisting of 0.5% formic 
acid (A): acetonitrile containing 0.5% formic acid (B), at 
a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, with the following gradient pro-
file: 40% B (0 min), increasing from 40 to 70% (0–6 min), 
and 70% B (6–8 min). The transitions (precursor to daugh-
ter) monitored and retention times were 195.2–139.0  m/z 
[M +  H]+ for BHB (3.3 min), 892.4–308.4  m/z [M +  Na]+ 
for 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel (4.2  min), 892.4–324.0  m/z 
[M +  Na]+ for 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel. The linear regression 
of the concentration range of 1.00–125 nM of paclitaxel, 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel by the 
peak-area ratio of these compounds to BHB was calibrated using the least-squares method (r2 = 0.99). Data were 
expressed as relative activity (%), defined as the ratio of the 
content of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel or 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel 
incubated with the sample to that incubated without the 
sample. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC50) 
was calculated from the least square regression line made 
from 3 points that crossed 50% of the control logarithmic 
concentration values.
Culture of human cryopreserved hepatocytes
Plateable and interaction-qualified cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) were thawed 
in a hepatocyte thawing medium (Lonza) and then seeded 
at 5 ×  104 cells per well in collagen-coated 96-well plates 
(Corning, Corning, NY, USA) with hepatocyte plating 
medium (Lonza). After 1 h of incubation with 5%  CO2 under 
saturated humidity at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with 
fresh plating medium. After 4 h of seeding, the media were 
replaced with maintenance medium (Lonza) containing 
Matrigel (0.3 mg/ml).
Assay of induction of paclitaxel metabolism by GJG 
and its constituents in human cryopreserved 
hepatocytes
The CYP induction of GJG and its constituents on paclitaxel 
metabolism were studied using two methods: the evalua-
tion of metabolic activities by analyzing the amounts of 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel produced; 
and the measurements of mRNA levels.
After removing the medium containing Matrigel from 
the cells, the cells were treated with each test compound 
prepared in a maintenance medium (1, 3, and 10 µM). 
Rifampicin, a well-known CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inducer, 
was used as a positive control and treated under the same 
conditions. The cells were divided into two groups: one 
for the evaluation of mRNA levels and the other for the 
evaluation of metabolic activities of paclitaxel. To obtain 
the samples to evaluate mRNA levels, the cells were col-
lected 24 h after drug treatment (n  = 3 per test compound). 
To obtain the samples to evaluate the metabolic activities 
of paclitaxel, the maintenance medium containing each 
compound was replaced with fresh medium containing 
each compound at the concentration every 24 h over a 72-h 
treatment period. Following the compound treatment period, 
the culture medium was replaced with maintenance medium 
containing paclitaxel (10 µM). The supernatants were col-
lected to measure the production of paclitaxel metabolites 
after 60 min incubations (n  = 3 per test compound). The 
concentration of DMSO in the maintenance medium was 
0.1%. A cell viability assay using CellTiter-Glo (Promega, 
Madison, WI, USA) was used to ensure the absence of cell 62 Journal of Natural Medicines (2022) 76:59–67

toxicity during treatment with each compound. The incuba-
tion supernatants were mixed with acetonitrile containing 
niflumic acid (internal standard), and the concentrations 
of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel were 
measured using an LC–MS/MS which differs from that 
used in the inhibition assay in human liver microsomes: 
Prominence LC20A system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and 
an LCMS-8060 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shi-
madzu) were used. The mass spectrometer used an electro-
spray ionization source in the positive or negative ion mode 
with multiple reaction monitoring. The analytical column 
was a Capcellpak  C18 MGIII-H (2.0 mm i.d. × 50 mm, 3 µm) 
(Osaka Soda, Osaka, Japan) coupled with a guard column 
(Opti-Guard Fit ODS, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, 
Japan) at 40 °C. The mobile phase was delivered using a 
linear gradient elution system, 0.2% formic acid (A): ace-
tonitrile (B), at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, with the follow -
ing gradient profile: 30% B (0–1 min), increasing from 30 to 
50% (3–7.5 min). As the analytical system and methods used 
in the induction assay and the inhibition assay were different, 
the MS transitions and retention times of paclitaxel metabo-
lites in this induction assay were reexamined. The transitions 
(precursor to daughter) monitored and retention times were 
283.15–245.10  m/z [M +  H]+ for niflumic acid (6.6 min), 
914.2–541.15  m/z [M +  HCOO]− for 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel 
(5.7 min), 870.33–122.20  m/z [M +  H]+ for 3′ -p-hydroxy -
paclitaxel (6.6 min). The linear regression of the concentra-
tion range of 25 pM–10 µM of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 
100 pM–10 µM of 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel, respectively, by 
the peak-area ratio of these compounds to niflumic acid was 
calibrated using the least-squares method (r2 = 0.99).
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR analysis
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were carried out using 
the Superprep II Cell Lysis & RT Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, 
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time 
PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan assay probes 
and TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a Quantstudio 7 real-
time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. TaqMan assay probes used are 
Hs00604506_m1 (CYP3A4), Hs02383390_s1 (CYP2C8), 
and Hs99999905_m1 (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehy -
drogenase; GAPDH). The relative expression levels of the 
target genes were normalized to that of the housekeeping 
gene GAPDH. Data are expressed as fold-changes to the 
vehicle control.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses for each group measured for 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel or 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel shown in the graph of Figs.  1 and 2 , and all groups shown in the graph 
of Figs.  3 and 4 were performed using one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett’s multiple t -test using PASW 
Statistics (version 18, SPSS; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), 
respectively. A probability value less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
Results
Inhibitory effect of GJG on paclitaxel metabolism 
in vitro
To confirm the reliability of the assay of inhibition of 
paclitaxel metabolism using human liver microsomes, the 
inhibitory effect of quercetin, used as a positive control for 
the inhibition of CYP2C8 [20], was preliminarily investi-
gated. Resultantly, quercetin inhibited the production of 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel by 49% (% of control) at 0.3 µM and 
29% at 3 µM. GJG significantly inhibited the production 
of both 3′ p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel 
in vitro in human liver microsomes in a concentration-
dependent manner (Fig.  1), and  IC50 of GJG were 4.5 and 
7.8 mg/ml, respectively.

microsomes. Geniposidic acid, catalpol, and loganin sig-
nificantly induced the production of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel 
at 50 µM, and genipodic acid induced the production of 
3′-p-hydroxypaclitaxel at 50 µM. Neoline significantly 
induced the production of both metabolites at 5.0 µM. 
However, at 50 µM, neoline significantly inhibited the 
production of 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel. Paeoniflorine and 
plantagoguanidinic acid did not affect paclitaxel metabo-
lism at any concentration, ranging from 0.050 to 50 µM.Inducing effects of the constituents of GJG

mRNA expressions in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Plantagoguanidinic acid at 3 µM significantly reduced 
CYP2C8 mRNA expression. However, other compounds 
did not exhibit any inducing effect on CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C8 mRNA expressions.
In addition, the metabolic activity of paclitaxel by the 
hepatocytes treated with these compounds was evalu-
ated. Rifampicin significantly induced the production of 
both 3′ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel by 
human hepatocytes; however, concentration-dependence 
was only observed in the production of 3′ -p-hydroxypa-
clitaxel. None of the evaluated constituents of GJG had 
any effect on the production of both 3′ -p-hydroxypacli-
taxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel by human hepatocytes at 
1–10 µM (Fig.  4).Discussion
In the present study, GJG inhibited paclitaxel metabolism 
in vitro in human liver microsomes in a concentration-
dependent manner with  IC50 valuers of 4.5 mg/ml for 
3′-p-hydroxypaclitaxel production and 7.8 mg/ml for 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel production. Since Kampo medi-
cines contain many kinds of compounds including not 
only plant secondary metabolites but sugars and various 
ions, these inhibitory effects of GJG with high concentra-
tions might not specific inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 and 
2C8. The one-time dosage of GJG (3 divided daily dose) 
is 1.5 g. When GJG is taken with a cup of water (200 ml), 
the concentration of GJG is calculated as 7.5 mg/ml, and Fig. 3  Inducible effects of

cytes. Human cryopreserved 
hepatocytes were incubated 
with test samples for 24 h. 
Then, total mRNA was col-
lected, and the expression levels 
of CYP3A4 (A) and CYP2C8 
(B) were evaluated by quantita-
tive PCR analysis. The relative

coincided with the  IC50 values. Therefore, the inhibitory 
effects of GJG on the metabolism of orally administered 
substrates of CYPs might appear in small intestine just 
after administration of GJG. However, since the results of 
CYP inhibition in in vitro experiments exhibited exces-
sively high potency [22], in vitro results should be inter -
preted carefully. Indeed, the drugs can be further diluted 
by intestinal fluid, and not all constituents cannot be 
absorbed from intestine into the blood circulation. Based 
on the in vitro inhibitory activity of Kampo medicines 
on CYP3A4 described in our previous study [13], it is 
speculated that the possibility that GJG may inhibit the 
metabolism of paclitaxel in clinical practice might be quite 
low by such high  IC50 values. Since Among the crude drug 
components of GJG, the extracts of Moutan bark had rela -
tively high inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 in vitro [23], 
and the extracts of Moutan bark, Alisma tuber, Cinnamon 
bark, and Poria scletotium inhibited CYP3A4 in human liver microsome fraction with  IC50 values of 0.10 mg/ml, 
0.39 mg/ml, 0.42 mg/ml, and 3.0 mg/ml, respectively [ 13]. 
It has been reported that the extracts of Dioscorea rhi-
zome inhibited CYP2C8 in the human liver microsomes 
with  IC50 values of 0.24 mg/ml [24]. These crude drugs 
may contribute to the inhibitory effect of GJG on the 
metabolism of paclitaxel to 3 ′-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 
6α-hydroxypaclitaxel. However, the in vitro experiment 
using crude drug extract is limited because the major tis-
sue where paclitaxel is metabolized is liver, and not all the 
components of GJG can be absorbed from intestine into 
the circulation.
Next, we evaluated the inhibitory and the inducing 
effects of the representative constituents of GJG that can 
be appeared in the blood circulation after the oral adminis-
tration of GJG on paclitaxel metabolism. Geniposidic acid 
and plantagoguanidinic acid are the marker compounds 
of Plantago seed [25, 26], and these compounds can be Fig. 4  Effect of representative

then incubated with paclitaxel 
for 60 min. The concentrations 
of 3′-p-hydroxypaclitaxel (A) 
and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel (B) 
were measured using LC–MS/
MS, and the data are shown as 
mean ± S.D. (n = 6 in con-
trol, n = 3 in each chemical).

absorbed in the unchanged form in rats orally treated with 
Plantago seed extract [27, 28]. Paeoniflorin and catalpol 
are the marker compounds of Moutan bark and Rehmannia 
root, respectively, and these compounds are detected in 
the blood of rats orally treated with shimotsuto extract 
[29]. Loganin is the marker compound of Cornus fruit and 
can be absorbed as the original form in rats orally treated 
Cornus fruit extract [30]. Neoline is the active compound 
in processed Aconite root for neuropathic pain and is well 
absorbed from the rat intestine into the circulation [8 , 
19]. Except neoline, none of these compounds inhibited 
paclitaxel metabolism in human liver microsomes at con-
centrations of 50 µM or less in vitro. Although neoline 
significantly induced the production of these metabolites 
at 5 µM, the induction ratios were less than 10% without 
concentration-dependence. In contrast, plantagoguani-
dinic acid significantly reduced the mRNA expression of 
CYP2C8 at 3 µM in human cryopreserved hepatocytes 
without affecting the production of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel. 
Therefore, these results are within the margin of error. 
Some of these compounds exhibited inhibitory or inducing 
effects on paclitaxel metabolism in human liver micro-
somes at 50 µM. When the extract of processed Aconite 
root (1 g/kg as the original crude drug), which is approx-
imately 50 times the daily dosage in humans, is orally 
administered to rats, the maximum blood concentration of 
neoline is approximately 80 nM [8 ]. Therefore, the con-
centration at 50 µM is much higher than that achieved in 
clinical practice. It is speculated that these compounds 
would not exhibit any effects on paclitaxel metabolism, 
though these in vitro results are difficult to be translated 
into clinical practice.
In conclusion, the present study provides drug infor -
mation about combination therapy with GJG product and 
paclitaxel, and GJG would not cause pharmacokinetic 
interactions via CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 when the patients 
are administered the regular dosage. Future clinical studies 
of GJG product are required to confirm its safe usage and 
to prevent drug interactions.
