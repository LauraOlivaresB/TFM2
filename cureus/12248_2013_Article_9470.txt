Abstract. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have issued
new guidance for industry on drug interaction studies, which outline comprehensive recommendations ona broad range of in vitro andin vivo studies to evaluate drug –drug interaction (DDI) potential. This
paper aims to provide an overview of these new recommendations and an in-depth scienti ﬁcally based
perspective on issues surrounding some of the recommended approaches in emerging areas, particularly,transporters and complex DDIs. We present a number of theoretical considerations and several caseexamples to demonstrate complexities in applying (1) the proposed transporter decision trees and
associated criteria for studying a broad spectrum of transporters to derive actionable information and (2)
the recommended model-based approaches at an early stage of drug development to prospectivelypredict DDIs involving time-dependent inhibition and mixed inhibition/induction of drug metabolizing
enzymes. We hope to convey the need for conducting DDI studies on a case-by-case basis using a holistic
scienti ﬁcally based interrogative approach and to communicate the need for additional research to ﬁll in
knowledge gaps in these areas where the science is rapidly evolving to better ensure the safety andefﬁcacy of new therapeutic agents.
KEY WORDS: drug –drug interaction studies; industry perspective; regulatory guidance.
INTRODUCTION
Drug –drug interactions (DDI) can cause profound clinical
effects, either by reducing therapeutic ef ﬁcacy or enhancing
toxicity of drugs. DDIs are one of the major causes for drugwithdrawal from the market ( 1). These factors when considered
together with an increasing frequency in polypharmacy has
prompted regulatory agencies, including the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency
(EMA), to publish guidance documents for industry that are
designed to help pharmaceutical researchers characterize andbetter understand DDI potential for a new molecular entity
(1,2). While DDI can result in alterations of either drug
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) or both, it isthe PK interactions that have been the main focus for both the
US and EU DDI guidelines. PK drug interactions, typicallycharacterized by alterations of plasma concentration –time
proﬁles, could be mediated viamechanistic changes in processes
of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or excretion
(ADME) of a drug substance (victim) by another compound(perpetrator) when they are given concomitantly. In both theEU and USA, the ﬁrst DDI guidance was published in 1997
(1,3), and the most recent guidance version has been issued as a
draft in 2010 (EMA) or 2012 (USA) ( 4). Compared to earlier
editions, both of the new draft guidance documents contain
much more extensive recommendations on in vitro andin vivo
studies. They suggest approaches to evaluate DDIs mediated via
cytochromes P450 (CYPs) as well as non CYP enzymes, and
including those in emerging areas of science such as modeling
approaches and transporters. The latest revisions are conceiv-ably based on the considerable scienti ﬁc progress made over the
last two decades towards understanding the role of drug
metabolizing enzymes in DDIs, as well as increasing numbersof reports on effects related to transporters. The EMA ﬁnal
version has recently been issued in July 2012, with an effective
date of January 2013 ( 5). The US guidance has yet to be
ﬁnalized; reviews of public comments from the due date May
2012 are presumably in progress, and therefore it is possible that
the recommendations in the current draft may not be part of the
ﬁnal recommendations. Nevertheless, the newer aspects of the
draft guidance seems to have already been implemented at the
FDA, as Merck Research Laboratories has already received
several speci ﬁc recommendations from FDA reviewers that
referenced the latest draft guidance.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article

overview on the new draft of the US and ﬁnal EU guidance
documents, with respect to their similarities/differences in the
recommended DDI studies and associated approaches, and (2)
highlight potential complications associated with aspects of theproposed emerging approaches to evaluate transporter-mediat-
ed DDIs and application of model-based predictions in early
drug development for predicting potential for DDIs arising fromtime-dependent inhibitors (TDI) and mixed TDI/inducers. We
exemplify our concerns with case examples gathered from the
literature and our own internal drug development programs.Finally, we put forward an approach from an industry perspec-tive in applying the regulatory guidance to support drug
development. It is our intention that this paper would promote
a continued scienti ﬁc dialog on the optimal means for imple-
menting DDI research and be helpful in molding guidance
recommendations in the aforementioned evolving areas.
OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST REGULATORY
GUIDANCE ON DDI STUDIES: WHAT IS NEW
Both US and EU guidance documents contain many new
features and are similar in concepts. The key common
updates can be summarized as follows:
&An increased emphasis on transporter-based DDI
evaluations, involving both in vitro andin vivo studies
of many different transporters.
&A more detailed guidance on how to incorporateresults from in vitro enzyme/transporter studies to
inform the nature and extent of clinical DDI studies.
Application of model-based approaches, and espe-cially physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK),
are highly recommended. Results from PBPK analy-
sis carries more weight than other models.
&An expansion of the guidance on DDI evaluations to
include metabolites.
&An emphasis on the need to understand and charac-
terize the impact of various enzyme/transporter
genotypes and other complex DDIs
Some speci ﬁcs are described below.
FDA Draft Guidance
Compared to the 2006 Guidance version, many more
studies have been added in this new guidance (Table I). With
respect to studies on drug metabolizing enzymes, key changes
include recommendations on approaches to studying DDIs forsubstrates of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs; Fig. 2 of
the draft guidance). Surprisingly, guidance does not mention
DDI evaluations for UGT inhibitors. For in vitro evaluations of
CYPs, there were no signi ﬁcant changes except explicit inclusion
of time-dependent inhibition to be studied for all major CYPs.
For enzyme induction studies, an evaluation of the change inmRNA levels is now the recommended end point replacing theprevious recommendation of using enzyme activity measure-
ment. Other major changes center around recommended
model-based approaches and associated criteria in using in vitro
CYP inhibition and induction results to determine the need for
in vivo DDI studies. These approaches are recommended for
not only CYP inhibitors or inducers, but also compoundsdemonstrating time-dependent inhibition and those with mixed
inhibition and induction effects (Fig. 4 of the draft guidance).The models included are both basic and mechanistic (static and
PBPK) in nature. In particular, mechanistic PBPK models have
been emphasized and mentioned numerous times in theguidance. Indeed, while the agency recommends a stepwise,
model-based evaluation of metabolism-based interactions start-
ing from a basic model for initial assessment, the criteria set forthe basic (based on total C
max) and mechanistic static models
(with “AUCR ”values; fold changes in area under plasma
concentration –time curve, AUC, of a probe substrate in the
presence and absence of a perpetrator, of 0.8 –1.25) are so
conservative such that PBPK will ultimately be needed. There
are also speci ﬁc recommendations with respect to testing DDI
potential due to metabolites, especially those with circulatinglevels of ≥25% or more of the parent compounds ’exposures.
On the transporter front, six additional transporters (organ-
ic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 ( SLCO1B1 ),
OATP1B3 ( SLCO1B3 ), organic cation transporter OCT2
(SLC22A2 ), organic anion transporters OAT1 ( SLC22A6 )a n d
OAT3 ( SLC22A8 ), and breast cancer resistance protein BCRP
(ABCG2 )) have been included on the list to be studied, on top of
the existing P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1 ). The guidance on
transporters is rather detailed w ith many decision trees, mirror-
ing what had been proposed by the International TransporterConsortium (ITC) with respect to considerations as to when toconduct in vitro andin vivo transporter studies, and including a
listing of recommended inhibitors and probe substrates ( 6), but
with somewhat more stringent criteria. Speci ﬁcally, a more
stringent cutoff of 25% for the involvement of hepatic eliminationor renal secretion is recommended by FDA, to trigger evaluation
of drugs as substrates of OATP1B or OCT/OAT, instead of 30%
or 50% cutoff, respectively, recommended by the ITC.Additionally, the FDA recommends using total C
max(vs
unbound Cmaxby ITC) to estimate the value for inhibitor
concentration “I1”for BCRP and Pgp inhibitors, and the cut-off
“R”(fold change in exposure of s tatins, OATP1B substrates)
value of 1.25 calculated based on an absorption rate constant kaof 0.1 min
−1(vs“R”value of 2 calculated based on the kavalue of
0.03 min−1by ITC) for OATP1B inhibitors (see additional details
in the “Transporter-based DDIs ”section below).
With respect to in vivo DDI studies, one key change
involves recommendations to include a third arm in clinicalstudies to evaluate the time required for activity to return to
baseline when evaluating an enzyme inducer or TDI. For
compounds with concurrent inhibition/induction (such as rifam-pin which is a known OATP1B inhibitor and CYP3A inducer),
additional study arms may be needed to determine appropriate
timing of administration of substrate and duration of interactioneffect. Additionally, both UGT1A1 and OATP1B1 have nowbeen included on the recommended list for genotyping or
phenotyping studies, expanding the original panel of poly-
morphic enzymes CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6. For the ﬁrst time,
the guidance also includes recommendations to conduct drug
interaction studies for therapeutic proteins, with primary focuses
onin vivo (much less on in vitro ) clinical studies for cytokines or
cytokine modulators. The changes include recommended stud-
ies for these protein-based drug products that will be used in
combination therapy with other drug products (small moleculeor proteins) or those with the potential for PK- or PD-related630 Prueksaritanont et al.DDIs based on prior experience/known mechanisms. The
recommendation to conduct clinical DDI studies are particularly
important if speci ﬁc labeling language is sought. In an absence
of the studies, general labeling language indicating potential forinteractions with CYPs or transporters is allowed for cytokines/
cytokine modulators.
EMA Guidance
Similarly, there are numerous changes in the latest EMA
guidance as compared to the 1997 version (Table I). While
the latest EMA guidance is similar in concept to the 2012
draft US guidance, it contains some major differences. Keydifferences summarized in Table IIinclude overall style, the
type of recommended in vitro studies, approaches and criteria
to help determine whether in vivo clinical studies are needed.
Notably, the EU, and not the USA, provides guidance on
timing as to when studies should be performed (e.g., most of
in vitro studies before phase II start). In addition, the criteria
used for CYP inhibition, especially for the basic model, totrigger in vivo clinical studies are quite different between thetwo agencies. The EU favors the use of unbound plasma
concentrations to re ﬂect the concentration of the inhibitor at
the site where the enzymes reside, whereas the USA
recommends total plasma concentrations be used for thefront line predictions, conceivably to force further consider-
ations to the proposed funneling system with mechanistic-
based models as the next in line. Such differences in guidancerecommendation can pose a dif ﬁcult challenge to drug
developers especially when the same experimental data may
give rise to different predictions and interpretations of the
potential for drug interactions based upon these differentspeciﬁcations by the authorities. For example, a compound
with a very low plasma protein binding value may be
considered exhibiting low potential for DDIs not requiring aclinical DDI study based on the US but not the EU guidance,
andvice versa . Additionally, while the US provides speci ﬁc
recommendations on the use of predictive models based on in
vitro data for compounds with mixed inhibitory and induction
effects on CYPs, the EU speci ﬁcally states that in vivo clinical
studies need to be conducted for these compounds, givenlimited experience in DDI predictions for the mixedTable I. List of New In Vitro Studies Recommended by the Latest Regulatory (US and EU) Guidance

provides no speci ﬁc guidance on evaluation of UGT sub-
strates, but instead explicitly recommends testing compounds
for inhibition of UGT1A1 and 2B7.
Other major differences are in the area of transporters.
The EU guidance includes human bile salt export pump
(BSEP) as another transporter to be studied, primarily for
safety reasons, and provides only a more general guidance ontransporter studies versus a prescriptive decision tree ap-
proach proposed in the US draft guidance. Similar to the
criteria used for drug metabolizing enzymes, the EU usesunbound plasma concentration (vs total concentrations by theUS) for establishing the transporter criteria (see additional
details in the “Transporter-based DDIs ”section below). The
EU also provides more clarity on the need to conduct in vitro
andin vivo DDI studies related to metabolites. Furthermore,
the EU, but not the USA, includes guidance on protein
binding displacement. In contrast, the EU guidance focusesonly on small molecule drugs; the EU provides more limited
guidance on DDIs related to therapeutic proteins, primarily
immunomodulators, in a separate guidance document ( 7).
POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED
WITH SOME OF THE RECOMMENDED
DDI STUDY ASPECTS
In this section, we present a number of theoretical
considerations and speci ﬁc examples, on issues surrounding
some of the proposed recommendations in emerging areas.
Speci ﬁcally, potential complications associated with transport-
er-based DDIs and model-based approaches for predictingtime-dependent effects, including mixed enzyme inhibition –
induction, are highlighted and discussed in depth.
Transporter-Based DDIs
In contrast to CYP-mediated DDIs where knowledge
gained over the past 20 –30 years has established a foundation
for more quantitative predictions of drug clearance and
potential for DDI, our understanding of the potential for
DDI arising from interactions with transporters is still in itsinfancy. Indeed, the EU guidance, while emphasizing the
importance of transporter-based DDI evaluations, only
provides a more general recommendation on studyapproaches, acknowledging that in vitro /in vivo extrapolation
of drug transporter interactions is currently less mature and
requires additional experience and continued scienti ﬁc devel-
opment. Presented below are four key scienti ﬁc consider-
ations to help illustrate the complications associated with
evaluations of transporter-mediated DDIs in general and
pertaining to the regulatory guidance, supportive of our viewthat given the current stage of knowledge in this ﬁeld, it is
premature to provide and apply a detailed guidance on
transporter studies and associated criteria on a broad basis.
Complications Related to Multiplicity of Transporters
Unique to transporters is their multiplicity nature, which
poses one of the greatest challenges to our understanding of the
role of a speci ﬁc transporter in drug disposition and its impact on
DDIs. Transporters, uptake or ef ﬂux, are directional, havebroad tissue distribution, and are involved in multiple drug
disposition processes. Many transporters have overlappingsubstrate speci ﬁcity which causes the functional redundancy.
These transporters may work in sequential transport steps,
parallel directions, or countercurrent (opposite) directions. Forsequential transport activities, the impact of transporter inhibi-
tion on drug disposition will depend on whether the transporter
is rate limiting to the overall disposition process. In the case ofparallel or countercurrent transport processes, the impact of
individual transporters will be dependent on their relative
contributions to the overall process. Further complicating this,inhibition of one transporter can be compensated for by anothersuch that there are no measurable effects on drug disposition
(examples are provided in subsequent sections below; additional
examples can be found from references 15and27in Table III).
In such cases, extrapolating in vitro
inhibition studies to in vivo
PK implications can be misleading. Moreover, if both the
perpetrator and the victim interact with multiple transporters,the effects can be unpredictable, dose-dependent, and highly
variable, particularly in cases where transporters function in
opposite directions. These complexities limit direct extrapola-tion of in vitro results to the in vivo situation based simply on
whether a compound is a substrate or inhibitor of an individual
transporter of interest, and highlight the need for a comprehen-sive holistic understanding of transporters involved in drugdisposition. Considering the large number (over 400) of gene
products from the human ABC and SLC transporter gene
families ( 6), comprehensive understanding of the contribution
of each individual transporter to drug disposition is not readily
achievable with currently available tools.
The complexities introduced by th e transporter multiplicity
can be further highlighted by several in vivo studies. Recent
results ( 16) showed that in comparison to a small impact of
Oatp1b2 knockout on pravastatin pharmacokinetics, a mores u b s t a n t i a la l t e r a t i o ni ni t sP Kw a so b s e r v e di nO a t p 1 a / 1 bknockout mice in which elimination of both Oatp1a and 1b
activities resulted in a sevenfold increase in systemic exposure.
However, inhibition of activities of multiple transporters withactivities counter to each othe r can also have a compensatory
effect such that the net effect on PK cancel each other out. In thecase of oral administration of methotrexate ( 17), individual
knockout of Mrp2, Mrp3, and Bcrp resulted in 1.4, 0.8, and 1.7-fold changes in the systemic exposure. Dual knockout of Mrp2and Bcrp resulted in three-fold increase in methotrexate systemicexposure (measured by AUC). H owever, additional knockout of
Mrp3 reduced the systemic expos ure back to levels in wild-type
(wt) mice (AUC in the triple knockout mice was 90% of that in wt
mice). While the observations ca n easily be understood based on
the orientation of Mrp3 transport relative to Mrp2 and Bcrpefﬂux, prospective predictions, based on the inhibition of
individual transporters is dif ﬁcult in the absence of a more holistic
understanding of the elimination process.
An added important barrier to this comprehensive view
is the fact that new information on transporters continues to
rapidly evolve. In this regard, recent publications ( 18,19)
suggested that multidrug an d toxin extrusion proteins
MATE1 and MATE2-K may be more important renal trans-
porters than OCT2, one of the renal transporters recommen-ded to be studied by both the ITC and regulatory agencies.
Cimetidine, currently recommended by the draft FDA
guidance as an in vivo inhibitor for OCT2, is a more potent632 Prueksaritanont et al.inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K. Similarly, metformin, the
recommended in vivo OCT2 probe, is not as sensitive a probe
for OCT2 as OCT1 and MATE1/MATE2-K, which also
contribute to its hepatic and renal disposition. It is worthmentioning that this rapidly evolving science could make
many prescriptive aspects related to transporter-based DDI
described in the draft US guidance outdated soon after it isﬁnalized. Additionally, the cimetidine case study illustrates
the importance of demonstrating whether the transporter of
interest is rate limiting to the overall disposition, whichunfortunately cannot simply be obtained from an in vitro
determination of a transporter substrate as commonly prac-
ticed. Consistent with this, a single dose of the widelyaccepted clinically potent OATP1B inhibitor rifampin hadsigniﬁcant impact on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin
and glyburide, but not warfarin, in spite of the fact that
all three compounds have been shown in vitro to be a
substrate of OATP1B and susceptible to inhibition by
rifampin ( 28–30).Complications Due to Lack of Specific Inhibitors and Probes
for Transporters
Another important obstacle to our understanding of the
role of transporters in drug disposition and DDIs is the lack
of speci ﬁc inhibitors/probes for transporters, including those
on the recommended list in the current US draft guidance. Inthis regard, the ﬁndings of the ITC ( 6) indicate methotrexate
as a “selected substrate ”forﬁve transporters while cyclo-
sporine is listed as a “selected inhibitor ”for seven trans-
porters. The lack of speci ﬁc probes is largely a result of the
multiplicity of transporters, which in theory can be addressed
to some extent if speci ﬁc inhibitors were to be available.
Without speci ﬁc inhibitors/probes, result interpretations with
respect to the transporter roles and impact on DDIs can be
ambiguous, and there are severe limitations in extrapolating
the results from in vitro toin vivo and from one DDI study
with one transporter substrate/inhibitor to another. This
particular issue is fundamental to an ongoing debate withTable III. Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Levels of Drugs in Wild-Type Animals and Transporter Knock-Out (ko) Rodents

aTissue levels at 2 h post-oral dose633 Perspectives on Drug Interaction Studiesrespect to how important transporter-based DDIs are and to
general concerns regarding how to derive meaningful andactionable information based on the recommended in vivo
clinical DDI studies using a single probe or inhibitor as
described in the current draft FDA guidance.
Much of what is known today about the transporter
involvement in drug disposition is extrapolated from in vitro
studies using cells expressing endogenous transporters (e.g.,Caco-2 cells) or transfected with speci ﬁc transporters. Many of
these cell lines unfortunately also express signi ﬁcant background
levels of other transporters, requiring use of speci ﬁc inhibitors to
aid in proper identi ﬁcation of the role a given transporter may
play. However, given the de ﬁciency of speci ﬁc inhibitors,
interpretation of in vitro transport results in some cases may be
ambiguous and misleading. Similarly, the lack of selective
inhibitors poses a signi ﬁcant issue for determination of the in
vivo impact of speci ﬁc transporters on exposure. Even with
relatively speci ﬁc inhibitors, interpretation of in vivo studies
aimed at determining the impact of speci ﬁc transporters is not
straightforward. Early studies showed increased exposure (3.8-
fold) of imatinib when administered with the Pgp inhibitorvalspodar or the dual Pgp/Bcrp inhibitor elacridar in wt mice(31). These results were interpreted to support Pgp and Bcrp in
limiting imatinib exposure. Ho wever in a study by Oostendorp et
al. (32), coadministration with elacri dar or pantoprazole resulted
in a threefold higher systemic exposure and reduced clearance ofimatinib in both wt and Mdr1a/1b /Bcrp triple knockout mice.
Elacridar was speci ﬁc a l l yd e s i g n e dt ob e ,a n di sc o n s i d e r e da s ,a
Pgp/Bcrp inhibitor. Imatinib is a Pgp/Bcrp dual substrate which is
extensively metabolized by CY P s( C Y P 3 A ,1 A 1 / 2 ,1 B 1 ,2 C 8 / 9 ,
and 2D6) ( 33). Given that the knockout mice are de ﬁcient in both
Pgp and Bcrp activity, the changes in imatinib PK were ascribedto unanticipated inhibition of other elimination mechanisms
potentially mediated by Oatps or O cts. These results highlight
the lack of speci ﬁcity of even the best characterized transporter
inhibitors and are particularly concerning since unanticipated
effects on other drug elimination processes may compromise thecause –effect relationship needed for meaningful extrapolation of
in vitro inhibition data to avoid DDIs.
More concerning is that clinic a lr e l e v a n c eo fd r u gt r a n s -
porters in DDIs has been mainly derived based on studies withnonselective inhibitors and substrates. Cyclosporine (CsA) and
statins, commonly used as model inhibitors and substrates,
respectively, in clinical studies as well as in the draft FDAguidance have broad interactions with transporters and metab-
olism enzymes. Clinical DDIs r e p o r t e dw i t hC s A( a sp e r p e t r a -
tor) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)substrates were commonly cited to underscore the in vivo impact
of OATP inhibition. It is important to point out that as a known
immunosuppressant, clinical DDI studies with CsA have been
mostly performed in transplant patients who were on multipledrugs, and the clinical DDI data were often compared to historic
pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers resulting in generally
high DDI magnitude (Electronic Supplementary Material(ESM) Table S 1). As such, the results of these comparisons
may not accurately re
ﬂect interaction potential based simply
upon a mechanism of OATP inhibition. Only 4 out of 18 studieswere conducted in healthy subjects in an open-label, randomized,
cross-over or one-sequence design (ESM Table S 1). The results
from these healthy volunteer studies showed disparate effects ofCsA on the fold change of plasma AUC of atorvastatin (15.3-
fold; 34), pitavastain (4.5-fold, NDA #022363), bosentan (1.9-
fold;35), and repaglinide (2.5-fold; 36).In vitro , OATP-mediated
uptake has been shown as a major contributor for hepatic uptake
of these compounds ( 37,38). Nonetheless, differences in the
magnitude of the CsA impact in vivo among the four drugs likely
reﬂect the effects on multiple transporters (e.g., OATP1B1, -1B3,
Pgp, BCRP) and drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A).Furthermore, inhibition of transporters and enzymes by CsA
may occur either in the liver or gut. Thus, the wide-ranging
magnitude of DDI changes among these four drugs is a complexreﬂection of differences in the anatomical location and involve-
ment of multiple enzymes and tr ansporters involved in the
elimination of the drugs that are affected by CsA ( 39). It is also
important to note that CsA is known to have nephrotoxic andother undesirable effects ( 40), which might be additional
contributing factors to alterations in plasma exposure of victim
drugs, independent of its effect on drug transporters or enzymes.
These complications dampen the notion put forth in the US draft
guidance that CsA is a broad inhibitor of transporters and CYPs
and therefore the results from clinical DDI studies with CsAcould serve as the worst case scenario for substrates of trans-
porters and enzymes. In this regard, rifampin may serve as a
better alternative OATP1B1, -1B 3 inhibitor, provided that it is
given as a single dose and preferably intravenously to reducepotential complicatio ns due to its inhibitory effects on Pgp and
MRP2 at the intestinal level ( 28). Nevertheless, more research is
needed to con ﬁrm whether a single dose rifampin is indeed an in
vivoselective inhibitor of hepati c OATP1B, with minimal effects
on other yet to be identi ﬁed transporters.
Likewise, many clinically relevant DDIs mediated viadrug
transporters have been reported with nonspeci ﬁc substrates, and
the scarcity of selective inhibi tors presents a major barrier in
determining a relative contribut ion of an individual transporter to
overall uptake or secretion processes in a given tissue, critical
information linking to DDI poten tial. Rosuvastatin, recommen-
ded by the FDA draft guidance as a probe substrate for bothOATP1B1 and BCRP in the clinic, is generally believed not toundergo signi ﬁcant metabolism ( 41), and instead its elimination
and disposition mechanism is largely driven by transporters
including OATP1B ( 42)a n dB C R P( 43). Interestingly, the
magnitude of DDIs between rosuvastatin and several knownOATP inhibitors was at most twofold (fold changes of AUC was1.6-, 1.8-, 2.1-, and 1.4-fold for eltrombopag, gem ﬁbrozil,
lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipran avir/ritonavir, respectively) ( 11,44–
46
). The only exception is with CsA, with the fold change in AUC
of 7.1-fold, but this was observed in heart transplant patients
when compared with historical data in healthy controls (ESMTable S 1). A similarly modest change in rosuvastatin exposure
(fold change in AUC and C
maxwas 1.2 and 2.9, respectively) has
also been recently observed in a clinical DDI study with one of
our internal candidates (compound B in Table IV)w h e ng i v e na t
300 mg twice daily (BID) for 10 days with a single 5-mg oral dose
of rosuvastatin in healthy subjects. This compound was classi ﬁed
as a relatively potent in vitro inhibitor of OATP1B1 (IC 500
0.3μM, pitavastain as a probe s ubstrate), OATP1B3 (IC 500
0.3μM; bromosulfophthalein as a probe substrate) and BCRP
(IC50∼13μM; methotrexate as a probe substrate). The modest
changes reported thus far raise a question as to whether
rosuvastatin disposition is limited by these transporters and634 Prueksaritanont et al.therefore its suitability for being a recommended probe
substrate. In this regard, the current FDA transporter decisiontrees assume that a single transporter-mediated uptake/ef ﬂux
accounts for 100% of the elimination of a probe substrate orvictim drug, which is not the case for rosuvastatin and most, ifnot all, clinically used drugs. It is also noteworthy that
rosuvastatin undergoes renal elimination to some extent
(∼28% of total clearance) in humans ( 47), and that the notion
that rosuvastatin is eliminated mainly unchanged should beinterpreted with caution. Rosuvastatin is capable of undergoingglucuronidation and lactonization similar to other statins ( 47),
and rosuvastatin lactone has been observed in excreta and inplasma in humans ( 48–50), raising the possibility of an additional
complicating factor resulting from reversible metabolism. It
would be of high interest to conduct a clinical DDI study usingan intravenous single dose of rifampin to better assess the in vivo
relevance of OATP impact on rosuvastatin pharmacokineticswhile avoiding a potential complication due to gut Pgp-mediatedDDI (rosuvastatin has also been reported as a Pgp substrate
(39)). Additionally, since pitavastatin possess similarities to
rosuvastatin with respect to its interactions with transportersOATP1B1, -1B3, BCRP, Pgp and MRP2, and UGT enzymes,but with much less dependency on renal elimination pathway(39), we are currently conducting a clinical DDI study to
determine the relative impact of a single dose rifampin on the
PK of pitavastatin versus that of rosuvastatin. The outcome of
our ongoing clinical DDI study should provide valuableinformation regarding the clinical relevance of OATP1B andhelp determine whether pitavastatin, a currently employed in
vitro probe, may also be used as an in vivo probe for OATP1B.
Impact of Individual Transporters Alone on DDI is Usually
Small
Thus far, the magnitude of DDIs reported in clinical studies
with inhibitors or substrates of transporters other than OATP1B(see above), and particularly for the renal transporters OCTs
and OATs, is generally less than threefold ( 6). In principle, gene
knockout animals represent the most extreme case for DDI inwhich complete inhibition of transporter activity is achievable.
Although loss of one transporter may result in a compensatory
increased gene expression for complementary transporters andmetabolism enzymes, gene pro ﬁling results in Mrp2 ( 51)a n d
Oatp1b2 ( 26) do not show a clear gene expression pattern that
would compensate for the transporter knockout (e.g., in case of
Mrp2 knockout mice, loss of Mrp2 activity, and increase of Mrp4activity in liver would both contribute to increased systemic
exposure). Results to date in transporter knockout animals
showed changes in systemic exposure generally within twofoldin knockout animals in the absence of transporters commonly
cited as important in drug disposition, including Oatp1
(Table III). The only exception is with Bcrp knockout and
sulfasalazine where a much more dramatic impact on oralexposure (33-fold increase) was observed in the knockout rats
(13). Interestingly, this was not duplicated in humans, where
ABCG2 421 C>A SNP led to only a 2- to 3.5-fold increase inoral exposure of sulfasalazine ( 13and references therein).
Consistent with this notion, clinical data in subjects with genetic
mutations of transporters reported thus far with OATP1B1(SLCO1B1 ) and BCRP ( ABCG2 ) and other transporters also
showed less than or equal to threefold change in systemicexposure of substrate compounds. In a series of clinical studies
with the same group of subjects, the plasma AUC of simvastatin
acid, atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and ﬂuvastatin in
subjects with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype was 3.2-, 2.4-,
1.9-, 1.6-, and 1.2-fold greater than in those with the SLCO1B1 c.
521TT genotype, respectively ( 52–54). The ABCG2 c.421C>A
(rs2231142) SNP also affects the PK of several statins, including
rosuvastatin (2.0- and 2.4-fold greater in rosuvastatin AUC in
the c.421AA homozygote compared with c.421CA or c.421CCgenotypes, respectively), and atorvastatin, ﬂuvastatin, and
simvastatin lactone (increased exposure by about 1.7-, 1.7-,
and 2.1-fold, respectively, in subjects with the c. 421AA
genotype compared with c. 421CC reference genotype)(55,56
). As a comparison, changes in the exposure reported in
CYP knockout animals or human subjects with polymorphic
enzymes are much higher often >20-fold ( 57–59). The relatively
modest impact of genetic variation in drug transporters, when
compared to transporter DDI studies, in which the majority of
perpetrators, such as CsA, are inhibitors for multiple trans-porters/enzymes further supports that the magnitude of DDIs
reported with OATP inhibitors is likely overestimated, due to
multiple process/mechanisms involved in vivo .
The relatively small magnitude of transporter-mediated
DDIs or transporter polymorphisms prompts a larger question
of whether routine studies on many drug transporters, as
recommended by the recent guidance, are justi ﬁable. Given
the relatively small magnitude of DDI reportedly associated
with the renal transporters OCT and OAT, together with no
clear evidence thus far related to the impact of their genemutations on drug exposures, it would be more reasonable to
limit in vitro and in vivo studies of transporters only to
compounds that have, or to those likely to be prescribed withdrugs with, narrow therapeutic index. It is worth noting thatalthough the impacts of transporters on systemic exposure are
relatively modest, their effects on drug distribution or tissue
exposure could theoretically be more dramatic. Thus far, thishas been documented for mouse Mdr1 in which Mdr1 activity in
the blood –brain barrier minimized CNS exposure to Pgp
substrates. Knock-out of Mdr1 can lead to >10-fold increase inCNS exposure (Table III), while having little if any impact on
systemic exposure ( 21,60). In general, high systemic levels of
Pgp inhibitors are needed to signi ﬁcantly alter brain exposure,
and this has been shown not to be achievable with therapeutic
doses of commonly known transporter inhibitors, including the
most potent inhibitor CsA ( 61). Although it could be argued
that for some compounds changes in distribution can haveadverse effects, routine transporter substrate/inhibition studies
are unlikely to provide prospective predictions of distribution
and altered pharmacology. In such cases, more focused studiesaligned with preclinical safety studies to address whether
changes in tissue exposure correspond with observed toxicity.

(62). Such large differences have been ascribed to interlabor-
atory differences in the behavior of Pgp expression systems,
assay protocols, and the methods used to calculate IC 50
values. Similar in vitro system-dependent IC 50values have
also been observed with boceprevir; minimal inhibition
(<10% decrease in net transport) of Pgp-mediated digoxin
transport was observed using MDCKII-MDR1 cells, whilestudies in Caco-2 cells indicated that boceprevir as an
inhibitor of Pgp-mediated transport of digoxin, with IC
500
25μM(63). The reason for the discrepancy between these
two assay systems is unclear, but it may suggest thatboceprevir affects other uptake or ef ﬂux transporter
expressed in Caco-2 cells which are involved in the transport
of digoxin.
Substrate-dependent inhibition of OATP transporters has
also been reported, with different IC
50orKivalues with
different substrates, suggesting that OATPs have multiple
binding sites ( 64,65). Consistent with this, our recent studies
(63) using estrone sulfate and estropipate, potent prototypical
inhibitors for OATP1B1 ( 66), also yielded different IC 50values
for the uptake of pitavastatin (IC 50, 0.6 and 0.8 μM, respectively)
as compared to that of atorvastatin (IC 50>50, >10 μM, respec-
tively). Further complicating this is the fact that currently we
have little understanding of the kinetics of drug –transporter
interactions. The current assumption of a simple competitive
inhibition is commonly used to explain DDIs related to trans-
porters. However, recently emerging information suggests thatthis may not be the case. For example, CsA has been shown to
exhibit a long lasting inhibition on hepatic uptake of bromo-
sulfophthalein, a probe substrate for OATPs, in rats ( 67), and on
OATP1B1 and -1B3 mediated uptake in vitro (68,69).
Conceivably, this may be a contributing factor, amongseveral others, to the unusually high magnitude of DDIs
associated with CsA.
The complexities associated with assay systems and
methodologies highlight the need to develop better toolsand approaches to appropriately model in vitro transport-
er data for IC
50determination. Indeed, this is an area of
focus by the ITC ( 62). Furthermore, assay methodology,
including clinically relevant probes or inhibitors, must be
harmonized in order for a single cutoff criterion as
currently suggested in both the EU and US guidancedocuments to provide meaningful information indicative ofDDI potential. It is also worth noting that the current
FDA criteria based on an Rvalue of 1.25 has been shown
to yield an unacceptably high false-positive (100%) shownfor OATP1B ( 70). This is concerning considering that
using the proposed criterion in vivo clinical DDI will need
to be conducted regardless of the in vitro outcome. In this
regard, our internal data based on IC
50values for limited
set of OATP1B inhibitors from a single in vitro assay
system (OATP1B1 transfected MDCKII cells with pita-vastatin as a probe substrate) also showed many falsepositives using the criteria proposed by both agencies,
either based on a ratio between inhibitor concentrations
(total for the US or free for the EU) and IC
50,o rRvalue
(US only), and many false negatives with the ITC criteria
Rvalue of 2 (Table IV), supportive of continued research
in this area, including searches for a more suitable in vivo
probe, to aid in a more rationale-based criteria setting.Model-Based Predictions of DDIs
Recently, there have been an increasing number of
publications on mechanistic modeling, including PBPK to
predict DDI mediated viaenzyme and/or transporter inhibition,
induction or both. Understandably, given the knowledge gained
with CYPs over the last few decades, many successful quanti-
tative predictions have been reported for the DDI magnitude inhumans due particularly to either inhibition or induction of
CYPs, although not without some false predictions ( 71–73).
Thus far, most of the reports on more complex DDIs, includingtime-dependent inhibition and mixed inhibition and induction,and enzyme-transporter interplays, are retrospective ( 74–76),
and successes in prospective predictions have not been well
established. Indeed, the EMA guidance explicitly excludes theuse of mechanistic modeling for quantitative prediction of the
interaction resulting from both induction and inhibition (revers-
ible or mechanism-based), citing limited experience as a reason.These modeling approaches, while theoretically sound, are
dependent heavily on quality inputs and fundamental knowl-
edge of the system, as well as comprehensive information aboutthe compound itself. While much is known about the former as
compared to transporters, the latter will not be easily obtained
in the early stages of drug development and will usually requirefurther support or validation with additional clinical experien-ces. In this section, we present arguments supported with case
examples to highlight complications associated with modeling
approaches for prediction of TDI and particularly mixed TDIand induction as described in the regulatory guidance. We hope
to convey that more research is needed even for CYP3A, the
most studied enzyme, as well as other enzymes, before therecommended model-based approach and associated criteria
can be reliably applied for these complex DDIs.
Predictions Using the Mechanistic Static Model for TDIs
and Mixed Inhibitors/Inducers
The so-called “mechanistic static model ”or“net effect ”
described in the US FDA guidance to assess investigational
drugs as inhibitors (reversible inhibitors or TDIs), inducers and
mixed inhibitors and inducers (Fig. 4 of the US draft guidance) isprimarily based on a model described by Fahmi et al.(77). The
proposed model relies on using a single maximum inhibitor
concentration at both the gut ( I
gut—total drug concentration in
the gut) and hepatic ( Ih—estimated maximum unbound liver
concentration) levels. In the original work ( 77),Ihwas based on
free systemic Cmaxfor the inactivation and induction portions
and free portal Cmaxfor the reversible inhibition portion of the
model. It remains unclear why different surrogates for the
perpetrator concentration (free systemic versus portal Cmax)
were required to optimize the model performance. The FDA ismore conservative in this regard recommending the use of free
portal C
maxforIhfor all inhibitor concentrations in the model.
Based on the database totaling 30 drugs, Fahmi et al.(77)
showed that while the predictions were within twofold of theobserved values for DDI mediated viaCYP inhibition (revers-
ible or mechanism-based) or CYP3A4 induction alone, the
success rate was low for compounds anticipated to be bothinhibitors and inducers. Of the ﬁve compounds tested that
belong to this class, only one compound was predicted well with
the mechanistic static model; all other predictions were at least637 Perspectives on Drug Interaction Studiestwo- to three-fold off (either false positive or negatives) the
observed values ( 77). It is important to point out that a twofold
cut off is commonly used as a criterion judging the success rate of
prediction models, and that the success rate was still low even
with a twofold cutoff for predicting mixed inhibition induction.The criteria proposed for an initial cutoff in the latest US
guidance is much more conservative, with predicted relative
AUC values of 80 –125%. Not surprisingly, a recent poster at the
2012 ASCPT meeting ( 78) shows up to a 90% false-positive rate,
with the higher end associated with TDI or compounds with
mixed inhibition and induction of CYP3A ( n012).
Similarly, we have experienced overpredictions with the
mechanistic static model based either on the free portal or
systemic C
maxfor all compounds ( n09) in our database that
qualiﬁed as TDIs and mixed inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A. In
fact, up to 10-fold and three- to ﬁve-fold overpredictions were
observed with the recommended free portal Cmax(calculated
based on the recommended default absorption rate constantvalue of 0.1 min
−1) and systemic Cmax(clinically observed Cmax
at steady-state, adjusted for free fraction), respectively
(Table V). In both cases, the predictions gave no false
negatives (Table V). In this analysis, an enzyme turnover rate
(kdeg) for CYP3A of 0.03 h−1was used; this kdegvalue has
recently been shown to yield more accurate predictions for timedependent inhibition of diltiazem and other TDIs on midazolam(74,79). Although limited, our data suggest that the results fromthe mechanistic static model m ay provide a more reasonable
estimate for DDI risk if clinically observed unbound C
max,
instead of the agency ’s recommended unbound portal Cmaxis
used. It is noteworthy that the default ka value of 0.1 min−1was
partly responsible for the difference observed between the twoapproaches, and that the previously recommended ka value of
0.03 min
−1by Ito et al.(80) would narrow, although not eliminate,
the difference (data not shown), and therefore may be a bettervalue of choice. Additionally, although the results thus far
support what appears to be the main intent from the regulatory
perspective of using the static model for ruling out the need to doclinical DDI studies, from a drug industry perspective thisperceived bene ﬁt is minimized by the hig h likelihood that the
predictions will suggest that essen tially no clinical studies can be
excluded, regardless of in vitro study outcomes.
Predictions Using Mechanistic Dynamic Models for TDIs
and Mixed Inhibitors/Inducers
The high incidence for overprediction by the static model is
not surprising given the fact that this model only captures the
maximum plasma concentration of the perpetrator. In theory,the next-in-line dynamic PBPK modeling approach recommen-
ded by both the agencies, which accounts for temporal change in
the perpetrator plasma concentrations, should improve theprediction, provided that the model incorporates all necessary

Indeed, a general trend of improvement was observed with aPBPK model using the same in vitro dataset (Table V; see also
ESM S 2)a n da k
degvalue as for the static model, but with
clinically observed plasma concentration-time pro ﬁles for the
perpetrators at steady-state (Table V). Notably, by using the
clinically observed perpetrator concentrations at steady-state,
our PBPK model results represent the best case scenario byreducing uncertainty in extrapolating the inhibitor concentra-
tions using translational bottom-up approaches. Despite this, a
2- to 3.5-fold over prediction was observed for compound 3(mixed inhibitor/inducer) and compound 4 (a TDI), suggestingsome limitations of the current model.
The model limitations are also supported by a recent
industry/FDA/academia collaboration that was recently com-pleted evaluating current static and time-based models for
induction DDI (C. Gibson, personal communication). Two
perpetrators included in the study were pioglitazone andtroglitazone, each of which has been shown in vitro andin vivo
to be inducers but also have clearly observable time-dependant
inhibition of CYP3A in vitro in a human liver microsomal
model. A summary of the PBPK model parameters for
pioglitazone and troglitazone and model validation using
existing clinical data are shown in ESM S 3. After incorporation
of all the observed in vitro induction and time-dependent
inhibition parameters for both perpetrators (ESM S 3), they
were both simulated to be net inhibitors rather than inducers, at
steady-state. With the k
degvalue of 0.03 h−1, the modeled GMR
(95% CI) for the pioglitazone/midazolam DDI was 1.87 (1.78 –
1.97) versus the observed GMR of 0.74, and the corresponding
value for the troglitazone/simvastatin DDI was 6.47 (6.10 –6.86)
versus the observed interaction of 0.59 ( 83). Interestingly, these
predicted results are the best-case outcome, given that the
prediction became worse using a kdegvalue of either 0.019 h−1
(predicted GMR 02.1 and 7.0 for pioglitazone/simvastatin and
troglitazone/simvastatin, respectively) or 0.008 h−1(predicted
GMR 02.8 and 8.8 for pioglitazone/simvastatin and troglitazone/
simvastatin, respectively); both kdegvalues have also been
commonly employed for CYP3A in many reportedlysuccessful DDI predictions resulting from CYP3A inhibition
(74,79,84). Furthermore, correction of the Ki and KI values of
pioglitazone and troglitazone using the measured nonspeci ﬁc
binding (0.11 and 0.07, respectively —data not shown) caused
the prediction to be even worse (i.e., predicted a greatermagnitude of net inhibition). These poor predictions, with
respect to both the magnitude and the direction of DDI
(predicted net inhibition vs observed net induction) weremade in spite of using clinically observed perpetrator
concentrations at steady-state of both troglitazone and
pioglitazone. Such examples strongly suggest de ﬁciencies in
the current model approaches and limiting their use inpredicting DDI liability of compounds with mixed time-
dependent inhibition and induction.
Complications Associated with Using a Single Value
of CYP3A4 Degradation Rate (k
deg) to Describe
Both Induction and Inhibition
While the kdegvalue of 0.03 h−1has provided reasonable
predictions for the magnitude of DDIs for many CYP3A-mediated TDIs, including several of our compounds, our
experience using the PBPK models to study the time course of
return to baseline for midazolam PK following 28 days ofrifampin administration to healthy volunteers suggest aCYP3A4 k
degof 0.008 h−1is required to describe the time
course of the “de-induction ”(85). For presentation in this
manuscript, the aforementioned studies were re-evaluated usingthe same version of simCYP (v11.1) and were modeled using
both k
degvalues (0.03 h−1and 0.008 h−1) for comparison to the
clinical observations. Additionally, the reversible and time-dependent inactivation parame ters of CYP3A4 by diltiazem
were modi ﬁed to Ki 036.1μM, KI 02.97μM and kinact 04.2 h
−1,
consistent to those previously published ( 79). All other model
parameters for midazolam, rifampin and diltiazem were used astheir default values in simCYP v11.1. As shown in Fig. 1a,t h e

Interestingly, although the temporal aspects of the rifampin
DDI were not well captured using a CYP3A4 kdegof 0.03 h−1,
the magnitude of the observed steady-state interaction onmidazolam was reasonably modeled using either value (0.03 or
0.008 h
−1). The diltiazem/midazolam DDI study published by
Friedman et al.(79) was evaluated similarly to test the sensitivity
to the CYP3A4 kdeg(Fig. 1b). In this case, the model using a
CYP3A4 kdegvalue of 0.03 h−1was able to simulate both the
temporal aspects and the magnitude of the observed DDI. As acomparison, a k
degof 0.008 h−1resulted in an overestimation of
the magnitude of the observed DDI as well as not capturing the
temporal aspects. Although it is possible that interstudy
variability may be the cause for the apparent difference in theCYP3A4 k
degvalue needed to describe the observed
interactions mentioned above, based on our experience it can
be reasonably concluded that in the current simCYP dynamicmodel of DDI there is not one value for the hepatic CYP3A4
k
degthat will account for both magnitude and temporal aspects
of time-dependant inhibition and induction. These exampleshighlight the complexities in prospectively predicting DDIs and
suggest a need for further model and/or parameter re ﬁnement.
Other Complications in Predicting DDIs due to TDIs
and Mixed Inhibition/Induction
In this section, we present three retrospective case
examples to further illustrate complicating factors associated
with the PBPK model-based predictions for compounds with
mixed inhibition/induction ( n02), and with only time-depen-
dent inhibition on CYP3A ( n01). Unlike the earlier exam-
ples, where clinically observed perpetrator concentrations at
steady-state were used to predict their effects on midazolam
exposure, these cases were based on PBPK models thatincorporated observed single dose and multiple dose clinical
phase I perpetrator PK data, along with other relevant model
parameters (CYP reaction phenotyping data and inhibition/induction parameters, physicochemical properties, etc.), to
simulate perpetrator concentrations at steady-state, and
predict subsequent effects on midazolam exposure (detailsprovided in ESM S 4). Although requiring a more extensive
data set, these models are considered more mechanistic,
leveraging the model to incorpora te changes in clearance for the
perpetrator drug as a result of its auto-inhibition/inductionpotential after multipl e dosing. This is an especially important
aspect of the model considering that the majority of compounds
are substrates of CYP3A, includi ng most of the compounds listed
in Table V. We conclude from these and the aforementioned case
examples that there is a signi ﬁcant knowledge gap to enable
reliable DDI predictions for com pounds of this nature (i.e., auto-
induction and/or auto-inhibition), and that clinical DDI studies
maybe unavoidable until more knowledge, on both the CYP
system, including the synthesis and degradation rates, and thedrug properties, is gained to help re ﬁne and validate the model.
Compound 3-Midazolam DDI. As indicated earlier, the PBPK
model based on clinically obs erved PK of compound 3 and its in
vitro CYP3A inhibition and induction properties, signi ﬁcantly
over predicted the in vivo impact resulting from the chronic
dosing of compound 3, with midazolam exposure re ﬂecting its netinhibitory effect on CYP3A (Table V). Preclinical in vitro studies
suggest that compound 3 may both inhibit and induce of CYP3A.B a s e do nac o m p r e h e n s i v es e to f in vitro andin vivo studies,
including ADME studies using a ra diolabeled tracer, compound 3
is expected to be eliminated by me tabolism in humans, primarily
by CYP3A4 with fraction metabolized by CYP3A (fm
CYP3A )o f
∼0.8. When the parameters describing these attributes were
incorporated into the PBPK model, an overprediction ofcompound 3 exposure was observe d following bid dosing for
28 days (Table VI), indicating again the net inhibitory effect on
CYP3A. This prediction was i nconsistent with the observed
multiple dose clinical PK pro ﬁle of this compound, which
suggested no net change in its clearance over this dosing period
(i.e., the accumulation ratio of ∼1.5 is expected based on its day 1
PK; ESM S 4). Although the over-prediction of exposure at
steady-state was minimized when the fm
CYP3A was arbitrarily
changed to ∼0.4, the prediction of its effect on midazolam
exposure was not improved (Table VI). It is worth noting that
in these simulations, the kdegv a l u eo f0 . 0 3h−1was used and the
results were better than t hose obtained with other kdegvalues,
including 0.019 h−1(Table VI). Additionally, the model provided
a reasonable prediction for mi dazolam exposure as a result of
reversible inhi bition after a single dose (day1) of compound 3
(Table VI), suggesting that the limitation of the current PBPK
models is primarily on a more complex time-dependent DDIaspect, involving simultane ous induction and inhibition.
Aprepitant-Midazolam DDI. Aprepitant is another drug which
has been shown in vitro to be a reversible ( 84) and time-
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 as well as inducer of CYP3A4(Table V). Furthermore, the apparent effects of autoinhibition
with subsequent autoinduction are apparent in the multiple dose
clinical PK pro ﬁle of the compound (Aprepitant, Summary of
Clinical Pharmacology Studies, Rahway (NJ), Merck, 2004, data
onﬁle). Increasing AUC is observed between days1 and 7 of
aprepitant dosing (160 mg QD), followed by a decreasing trendin exposure on day28 and back to baseline on day56 of chronic
dosing (Fig. 2). A minimal accumulation would have been
anticipated based simply on the day1 PK pro ﬁle with a linear
kinetic assumption (i.e., no changes in aprepitant clearance dueto auto inhibition or induction over the entire dosing period; the
aprepitant PK would remain relatively constant over the 56-day
dosing period). While our PBPK model (ESM S 4) reasonably
captured the increased exposure of aprepitant on day7 relative
to day1 as a net inhibitory effect on CYP3A activity, it was
unable to simulate the decrease in aprepitant exposure on days28 and 56, an apparent steady-state after chronic dosing (Fig. 2,
Table VI). The model predicted a net auto-inhibitory effect
through steady-state after 28 days of drug dosing although itwould appear that auto-induction had occurred. The inability to
accurately simulate the exposure of aprepitant on day56 was
accompanied by a poor simulation of the observed midazolamDDI on day56, regardless of which k
degvalue (0.03 h−1
(Table VI) or 0.008 h−1(data not shown)). Interestingly, on
day7, when the simulated aprepitant exposure was consistent
with observed clinical exposure, the midazolam AUC ratio wasaccurately predicted with a hepatic CYP3A4 k
degvalue of
0.019 h−1applied to the model. The kdegvalue 0.03 h−1resulted
in underprediction of aprepitant exposure on day7, and likewiseunderprediction of the observed midazolam DDI (Table VI).
This sensitivity of the PBPK model to the hepatic CYP3A4640 Prueksaritanont et al.parameter and its uncertainty, observable across several
disparate examples, suggest that it may be dif ﬁcult, even in the
most straightforward cases, to expect the level of precision
required to perform within traditional bioequivalence boundssuggested as cutoffs in the draft US guidance.
It is worth noting that the model was unable to predict
correctly, with regard to the directional effect (predicted net
inhibition vs observed net induction) on the perpetratorexposure, and that in spite of apparent autoinduction on itsown metabolism after 56-day dosing, aprepitant caused an
inhibitory effect on midazolam exposure (Table VI). The reason
for this is unclear and could not be due simply to inaccuratedetermination of fm
CYP3A for aprepitant as changing its
fmCYP3A from 0.9 to 0.7 did not improve the prediction (datanot shown). Additionally, a clinical DDI study conducted with
ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, caused ﬁvefold
increase in aprepitant ( 85), consistent with CYP3A being the
major metabolizing enzyme for aprepitant. The observedtemporal changes in the aprepitant exposure (increase on day7
then decrease on day28), but not of midazolam, suggest a
possibility for changes over time in the relative contribution ofCYP3A to overall metabolism of aprepitant that was not
replicated with midazolam. Although the underlying mechanism
remains to be investigated, this hypothesis is consistent with thefact that aprepitant is also metabolized, albeit to a very limited
extent by CYP2C in vitro , is not a potent inhibitor of CYP2C
(86), and that an inducer of CYP3A can also induce CYP2C
(87,88). This example highlights a kn owledge gap requiring moreTable VI. PBPK Model Predictions of Multiple Dose Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Drug Interaction with Oral Midazolam (2mg)

for the observed unpredictable time-dependent outcome, whichcould be incorporated into a more re ﬁned PBPK model that
better captures all potenti al contributing factors.
Compound 4-Midazolam DDI. Unlike the above two cases,
compound 4, is a substrate and TDI of CYP3A but isunresponsive in human hepato cyte cultures for mRNA
CYP3A4 induction suggesting it is not an inducer. Using asimilar PBPK modeling approach as described above (ESMS4), about a threefold over prediction of the accumulation
ratio of its own exposure was simulated following 10 days ofonce daily dosing (Table VI). This overprediction is sugges-
tive of autoinhibition, which was not observed clinically; theobserved PK on day10 was consistent with no change in
clearance from day1. The overpredicted accumulation was
reduced, but not eliminated even with fm
CYP3A set to 0.5
(data not shown); this fm CYP3A value was thought to be
unlikely as it is in contrast with the in vitro reaction
phenotyping studies with human liver microsomes andclearance mechanisms in ani mals, which suggested an
fm
CYP3A of∼0.9. While the approximately ﬁvefold over-
prediction in midazolam interaction is not unexpected giventhe overprediction in compound 4 steady state exposure, itwas surprising that there was still a 2.8-fold overprediction ofthe midazolam interaction even when the clinically observedsteady state PK pro ﬁle of compound 4 was well-matched by
specifying a time-independent apparent clearance based onthat observed in vivo (Table V). Thus, the model over
predicted the clinical consequence of the in vitro time-
dependent inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism ofboth the perpetrator compound 4 and the victim midazolam.
Several experiments were conducted to investigate potential
causes for these signi ﬁcant over predictions, including inves-
tigating reversibility of the inhibition. Such mechanisticunderstanding is required for modeling TDI since bothcurrent static and PBPK approaches to model DDI forcompounds are based on an assumption that there is a time-dependent irreversible loss of enzyme activity. The inhibitoryeffect of compound 4 was con ﬁrmed to be irreversible (data
not shown), ruling out this as a major contributing factor tothe poor modeled result. Results from studies in a humanhepatocyte model, which is a more complete system and hasbeen shown to yield in vitro inhibition parameters more
predictive of an in vivo system for some compounds ( 89,90),
showed that the inhibitory potency (kinact/KI ratio) was onlymarginally reduced (less than twofold), and the reduction hadminimal effect on improving the simulation of PK and DDI ofcompound 4 (Table VI). In addition, the predicted results
became slightly worse when simulations were conducted using
thek
degvalue of 0.019 h−1, instead of 0.03 h−1(data not shown),
suggesting that the overprediction is not due to the assumed kdeg
value. The disconnect between in vitro TDI and the in vivo effect
for compound 4 is not entirely clear at the current time, althoughsimilar observations have been published to highlight thecomplexity in obtaining accurate in vitro TDI parameters and
in DDI prediction for compounds behaving as TDIs in vitro
(91,92). This provides further support to the notion that
prospective PK and DDI modeling of time-dependent effectsusing PBPK is complex with the current knowledge of thesystem, even with availability of human PK data.CONCLUSIONS
The goal of regulatory gui dance is to ensure safe and
effective use of approved medicines. However, given thecomplications highlighted above a nd considering that the major-
ity of drug candidates will fail after a ﬁrst in human trials (>90%)
or after a proof of concept (POC) study (>60%) ( 93), the
recommendations and associated criteria proposed in the DDI
guidance, if not appropriately a pplied during drug development,
may result in increased unnecessary studies which add to the
already costly process of drug discovery and development ( 22).
This is particularly the case for th e transporter related studies,
where focus should be primarily on the more established trans-
porters Pgp and OATP1B1. Furthermore, we believe that these
transporter-related DDIs should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis using approaches supported by current scienti ﬁc knowledge
in the ﬁeld and with a holistic vie w considering the overall
properties of a drug candidate including the safety pro ﬁle of the
candidate and/or concomitant drugs. For the majority of com-
pounds, we question the need to conduct in vitro studies on a
routine basis or in vivo clinical DDI studies using the currently
recommended probe substrates /inhibitors in the US draft DDI
guideline, especially on drug transporters for which the role andimpact on drug disposition are presently less well established
relative to Pgp and OATP1B1.
Considering the complexities associated with predictions
of time- and concentration-dependent effects, clinical DDI
studies of TDIs and mixed inhibitors/inducers may beinevitable, and should be done after the clinical dose and
efﬁcacious exposure have been determined (i.e., after POC).
Given the current state-of-the-art, the recommended mecha-nistic model-based approaches (including PBPK) based solely
onin vitro results (bottom-up approach) are not recommen-
ded for prospective DDI prediction of these compounds.Instead, the dynamic PBPK models should be applied afteravailability of phase I human PK data. The PBPK-based
simulations which accurately capture the steady-state human
PK pro ﬁles may help ﬂag potential DDI issues in early
development and together with other considerations (e.g.,
anticipated safety margin, commonly prescribed medications
in targeted clinical trial populations) can be used to determinepotential risks and aid in prioritization/planning of a clinical
DDI strategy, but should not serve as an automatic trigger for
a clinical DDI study. When applicable, the regulatory criteriashould be used to rule out the need for conducting clinicalDDIs, although given the conservative nature of the guid-
ance, this maybe a rare occasion. With at least one properly
designed clinical DDI study from which the results can beused to validate a PBPK model and its assumptions, the
model may then be used to explore potential outcomes of
various “untested ”clinical situations (i.e., “what ifs ”), and
potentially in some cases, the predicted results could be used
to justify waiving certain clinical DDI studies. This important
role of PBPK will be increasingly realized during later stagesof drug development when much more information, including
a mechanistic understanding of a compound from targeted
issue-driven studies would have already been gained to help
parameterize and validate the model.
Overall, the new guidance documents contain many
helpful recommendations for assessing a new drug candidate
for its DDI potential mediated viadrug transporters and drug642 Prueksaritanont et al.metabolizing enzymes. However, there are signi ﬁcant knowl-
edge gaps necessitating continued research in the aforemen-tioned emerging areas to aid in developing and re ﬁning the
recommendations before implementation.
