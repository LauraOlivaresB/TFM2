What is known and objective: Antiretrovirals have a high drug interaction potential,
which can lead to increased toxicity and/or decreased efficacy. Multiple databasesare available to assess drug –drug interactions. The aim of our study was to compare
interaction identification for commonly used ARVs and concomitant medications
between six different online drug –drug interaction databases.
Comment: This was a cross-sectional review using each of the following six data-
bases: LexiComp
®, Clinical Pharmacology®, Micromedex®, Epocrates®, University of
Liverpool, and University of Toronto. Sixteen antiretroviral drugs and 100 of the
DrugStats Database “Top 200 of 2019 ”list of medications were included. Each of
the six databases identified a different number of actual or potential interactions.
The number of interactions ranged from 211 to 283.
What is new and conclusions: A variety of databases exist with inconsistent identifi-
cation of actual or potential drug –drug interactions amongst them. It may be benefi-
cial to cross-reference multiple databases prior to making decisions regardingpatient care.

1|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE
People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer as
a result of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the likeli-hood of encountering patients with chronic conditions continues to
grow.
1–4Providers are likely to encounter polypharmacy in this
patient population.
Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are known for their high drug interaction
potential, frequently due to CYP3A4 metabolism, including the risk of
interacting with common medications prescribed for many chronicdisease states. Drug –drug interactions (DDIs) can lead to increased
toxicity and/or decreased efficacy of one or multiple drugs. Adequateconcentrations of ARVs are critical to suppressing and maintaining an
undetectable HIV viral load and preventing the development of resis-
tance. The identification and appropriate management of DDIs can
reduce preventable harm.
Multiple databases are available for providers to check for drug
interactions and ensure patient safety when evaluating treatment reg-
imens. It has been demonstrated that drug interaction experts utilize avariety of methods to search for potential DDIs.
5Databases for asses-
sing DDIs are available through subscription and open-access plat-
forms. Previous studies have evaluated ARVs with concomitantmedications and demonstrated discrepancies between online DDIdatabases with older ARVs.

online DDI databases.
2|COMMENT
2.1 |Methods
This study was a cross-sectional review designed to identity differ-
ences in how online drug interaction databases identify and classify
ARV DDIs. Sixteen ARVs were selected by HIV-trained clinical phar-
macists to represent the most commonly used ARVs in each classin the United States. From the DrugStats Database “Top 200 of
2019 ”list of medications,
10the top 100 most frequently prescribedmedications were utilized for our study. All medications included in
the analysis are listed in Table 1.
Each unique drug pair was evaluated for DDIs in each of the
following six databases: LexiComp®, Clinical Pharmacology®,
Micromedex®,E p o c r a t e s®, University of Liverpool, and University
of Toronto. A description of the characteristics of the DDI data-
bases are described in Table 2. These were specifically selected to
represent a variety of databases av ailable including subscription
and open-access. The University of Liverpool and University of
Toronto databases were both HIV-specific, whereas the otherdatabases included are general DDI databases. Most databasesincluded grouped DDI severity in four categories. Lexicomp
®
included five categories and the University of Toronto database
included 3. Additionally, Lexicomp®and Epocrates®databases
both provide a clinical recommendation of how to address the DDI
as their severity category.TABLE 1 Medications Included

FIGURE 1 Actual or potential drug –drug interactions identified1722 COMMENTARY
We reviewed characteristics of each DDI database including their
severity ranking. We also assessed whether an actual or potential DDIwas identified for each ARV-concomitant medication drug pair, in
each of the six databases. The percent of pairs which resulted in a
DDI was also evaluated. Data were analysed using descriptivestatistics.
2.2 |Results
There were 1520 drug pairs evaluated for interaction, after removing
duplicates. Each of the six databases identified a different number ofactual or potential DDIs of any severity. The number of DDIs ranged
from 211 to 283. These are described in Figure
1. The most DDIs
were identified by Epocrates®and the least number of DDIs were
identified by Micromedex®. The percent of pairs in which a drug inter-
action was identified ranged from 13.9% to 18.6%.
3|DISCUSSION
Each of the six DDI databases identified a different number of actual
or potential DDIs between the ARVs and concomitant medications.
This variability has been demonstrated in multiple studies with otherdrug classes, outside of ARVs and with a variety of online DDIdatabases.
11–18Databases were selected to represent resources at
varying levels of access, including subscription and open access. Addi-
tionally, of the selected databases, some were general resources whileothers were HIV-specific. Each database has its own severity ranking
system and categories. There was no consistency between types of
databases and number of actual or potential DDIs identified.
Micromedex
®identified 211 drug interaction pairs, 60 pairs
fewer than the next most identified pairs by Lexicomp®. The remain-
ing five databases identified a similar number of actual or potentialDDIs, demonstrated by a range of 12 DDIs between the databaseidentifying the most interactions and the least interactions. The clini-
cal impact of each recommendation was not assessed, thus we are
unable to make conclusions on the relevance of the identified DDIs.
A similar study was performed by Pehlivanli et al. comparing
potential DDIs of immunosuppressants in kidney transplant recipients
in four different online data bases.
11Potential DDIs identified were
compared to a gold standard reference to determine sensitivity and
specificity of each database. Such a gold standard does not exist for
ARVs, making it difficult to determine a single, most-reliable onlinedatabase.
Our study is the only study to date specifically evaluating the
number of identified actual or potential DDIs between ARVs and con-comitant medications for six different DDI databases, but it is notwithout limitations. Our study only included 16 ARVs and 100 con-
comitant medications, assessing for only 1520 DDI pairs. Additionally,
the type of recommendation, severity, and clinical impact of each DDIwas not evaluated. Heterogeneity of DDIs identified amongst data-
bases was also not assessed. Finally, the Department of Health andHuman Services has frequently referenced guidelines with drug inter-
action recommendations, but this was not included in our review as itwas not a searchable database.
Online DDI databases do not consistently identify potential ARV
DDIs and such discrepancies could impact patient care. Cross-referencing databases may be beneficial when evaluating ARV DDIs.
Further evaluation of ARV DDIs is necessary. Future studies that
include more medications that are commonly taken, as well as over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements, are necessary.
4|WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS
Online DDI databases are a tool for clinicians to identify potential
DDIs between ARVs and concomitant medications, and to find guid-ance regarding management. A variety of databases exist with incon-
sistent identification of actual or potential DDIs amongst them.
Results should be interpreted with caution, and it may be beneficial tocross-reference multiple databases prior to making decisions regard-
ing patient care.
