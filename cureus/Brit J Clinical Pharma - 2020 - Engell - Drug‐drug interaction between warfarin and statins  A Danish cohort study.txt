ratio (INR) among warfarin users. However, available data is limited and conflicting.
We conducted a register-based cohort study to evaluate the drug-drug interactionbetween warfarin and statins.
By linking data on INR measurements and filled prescriptions, we identified warfarin
users 2000-2015 initiating simvastatin (n = 1363), atorvastatin (n = 165) or
rosuvastatin (n = 23). Simvastatin initiation led to an increase in mean INR from 2.40
to 2.71, with INRs peaking after 4 weeks, corresponding to a mean change of 0.32
(95%CI 0.25-0.38). High-dose and low-dose simvastatin led to comparable changes
(mean change 0.33 vs0.29). Initiation of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin lead to INR
increases of 0.27 (95%CI 0.12-0.42) and 0.30 (95%CI -0.09-0.69).
In conclusion, initiation of simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin among warfarin
users led to a minor increase in INR. The magnitude of this change is for most
patients likely of limited clinical relevance.

1|INTRODUCTION
The vitamin K antagonist warfarin is used in the treatment and
prevention of thromboembolic events.1–3Due to its narrow
therapeutic index, use of warfarin requires close monitoring of the
international normalised ratio (INR). Warfarin is metabolised by the
cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes, especially CYP2C9 ,4which
makes it highly susceptible to drug-drug interactions (DDIs).1,4Statins
are also metabolized by some of the same CYP enzymes and
transporters dependent of statin type, eg, simvastatin is metabolised
byCYP3A4 ,2C8,2D6 andMRP2 ,atorvastatin by CYP3A4, 2C8 and
OATP1B1, and rosuvastatin by CYP2C9, 2C19 and OATP1B1.5Due to several overlaps in indications of use, coadministration of
warfarin and statins is common.6,7A limited number of generally
conflicting studies have reported both that statin initiation leads to
moderate INR increases8–11and that small INR changes are of limited
clinical relevance.12,13Despite limited evidence of a clinically relevant
interaction between warfarin and statins, commonly used online DDI
guidelines consistently advise clinicians to increase the frequency ofINR monitoring and if necessary adjust the warfarin dose when initiatingstatin treatment.
14–16This results in additional consultations and
blood testing, burdening both the patient and the healthcare system.
To provide additional data on this potential DDI between statins
and warfarin, we conducted a large register-based study andReceived: 15 April 2020 Revised: 26 May 2020 Accepted: 3 June 2020

2|METHODS
2.1 |Base cohort and data sources
A base cohort was established by linking different Danish health
registries. The base cohort comprised all patients registered with at
least one INR measurement in the Copenhagen Primary CareLaboratory (CopLab) database. The database includes laboratory testresults from primary healthcare patients in the Copenhagen area of
Denmark from 2000 to 2015.
17,18During this period the primary
healthcare doctors in the Copenhagen area were served by theElective Laboratory of the Capital Region (ELCR). ELCR covers
approximately 1.2 million inhabitants and provides a wide range of
biochemical, physiological and cardiac tests. The CopLab databasedoes not include INR point-of-care testing (POCT) results from general
practice. The ELCR was accredited for International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) standards ISO17025 and ISO15189. Appendix Aprovides a detailed description of the INR assay.
For the cohort identified via CopLab, we retrieved data about
drug use from the Danish National Prescription Registry
19as well as
hospital diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR).20
Data linkage was done using the unique Danish Civil Registration
Number assigned to all Danish residents.21
2.2 |Study population
From the base cohort (see above) we restricted the dataset to patients
with at least two INR measurements, at least one recorded vitamin K
antagonist (VKA) dispensing and at least one statin dispensing. Withinthis cohort we identified all incident prescriptions for simvastatin,atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, defined as a prescription with no
preceding prescription for a statin within the last 2 years. If one
individual had two such incident prescriptions for the same statin,only the first was included. We further restricted to those with at
least one INR measurement 8 weeks before statin initiation, as well as
at least one INR measurement within 12 weeks after statin initiation.Finally, we excluded those with no VKA prescription within 180 days
before statin initiation and those aged <18 years at the time of statin
initiation.
2.3 |Main analysis
The INR results were measured from 8 weeks before statin initiation
to 12 weeks after statin initiation. We graphically depicted the
changes in INR values by mapping median, interquartile, and 10th and90th percentiles during this window. To formally assess the INR
changes, we estimated the increase in mean INR by comparing thelatest INR result in the before window to the first INR result
within weeks 3-6 after statin initiation (if any) by using a paired
ttest. We further assessed the median effect by estimating median
changes in INR levels for all statin-treated patients, as well as thosetreated with high- ( ≥40 mg) and low-dose (<40 mg) simvastatin in
secondary analyses. Finally, we calculated the proportion of patients
with an INR above the therapeutic interval (for most patients INRbetween 2 and 3), defined as INR > 4 and >5 by comparing the
proportion of patients 1-4 weeks prior to initiating simvastatin to the
proportion 3-6 weeks after.
All analyses were performed using STATA Release 14.1
(Stata- Corp, College Station, TX, USA). The study was approved by
the Danish Data Protection Agency. Since data is based on
anonymised register data neither approval from the Ethics Committeenor collection of informed consent was needed.
2.4 |Supplementary and sensitivity analyses
To assess the potential impact from other drugs interacting with
warfarin, the main analysis was repeated excluding patients with a
prescription for other potentially interacting drugs in the observation
period (8 weeks before to 12 weeks after the date of statin initiation).These drugs included specific antifungals, macrolides, quinolones,metronidazole and amiodarone as described in Appendix B.
11
Furthermore, the main analysis was repeated excluding patients
with a mechanical heart valve, identified through the NPR,22to assess
the potential influence of this patient group with target INR ranges
other than 2-3.23What is already known about this subject
Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window and
pharmacological characteristics that render the drug
highly susceptible to drug-drug interactions.
Statins and warfarin are often coprescribed due to
convergent clinical indications.
What this study adds
Initiation of statins in patients treated with warfarin is
associated with a minor increase in internationalnormalised ratio (INR), peaking at about 4 weeks after
statin initiation.
The observed association was similar for high- and
low-dose simvastatin.
The increase in INR is probably of limited clinical
relevance.ENGELL ET AL. 695

Finally, some INR measurements were labelled as imprecise (up to
5-7% higher than actual values) due to prolonged storage of the bloodsample before analysis of INR. We therefore conducted an analysis
where these INR measurements were discarded.

3|RESULTS
For the analyses, we included 1363, 165 and 23 warfarin users who
had been exposed to simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin,respectively, between 2000 and 2015.
For patients treated with simvastatin, atorvastatin and
rosuvastatin, the median ages were 72 years (interquartile range [IQR]64-79 years), 70 years (IQR 63-76) and 74 years (IQR 64-80), while
the proportion of males were 58%, 62% and 47%, respectively.
INR values increased slightly after initiation of simvastatin
treatment with a peak after about 4 weeks (Figure 1). Initiation ofsimvastatin was associated with an increase in mean INR from 2.40 to
2.71, corresponding to an increase of 0.32 (95%CI: 0.25-0.38,
P< 0.001) while the median INR change was 0.2 (IQR –0.3-0.8)
(Figure 2). During a time window of 1-4 weeks before initiation of
statin treatment, 3.4% of patients had at least one INR measurement
above 4. This proportion increased to 9.0% during 3-6 weeks afterinitiation of statin treatment ( P< 0.01). Similarly, the proportion ofpatients with INR > 5 increased from 1.3% before initiation of statin
treatment to 3.2% after ( P< 0.01).
When stratifying by simvastatin dosage, we found that initiation
of both high-dose ( ≥40 mg) simvastatin (0.33, 95%CI 0.25-0.42) and
low-dose (<40 mg) simvastatin (0.29, 95%CI 0.20-0.38) was associatedwith a similar modest increase in mean INR. The median change in
INR was 0.2 (IQR −0.3-0.9) and 0.3 (IQR −0.2-0.8) for patients
receiving high and low simvastatin dose, respectively (Figure 2).
Considering atorvastatin, initiation of treatment was associated
with an increase in mean INR from 2.42 to 2.69 (change 0.27, 95%CI
0.12-0.42, P< 0.01), while for rosuvastatin it was associated with a
corresponding increase from 2. 31 to 2.61 (change 0.30, 95%CI –
0.09-0.69, P= 0.121). Analyses of high dose vslow dose were prohibited
by low statistical power for both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.
Sensitivity analyses excluding patients filling prescriptions for
other potentially interacting drugs (n = 77), patients with a mechanical
heart valve (n = 110), and INR measurements labelled as potentially
imprecise (n = 81 patients with no alternative measurements) yieldedvirtually unchanged estimates (data not shown).
4|DISCUSSION
In this register-based study based on a primary healthcare population,
we found that initiation of simvastatin was associated with a minor, but
statistically significant, increase in INR of 0.32 (95%CI 0.25-0.38,
P< 0.001), peaking approximately 4 weeks after initiation. We observed
a similar response in patients initiating treatment with atorvastatin androsuvastatin, although it failed to reach statistical significance. Sufficient
data to allow analyses was not available for other statins.
The main strength of this study is the use of data obtained from
daily routine work in primary health care with limited risk of selection
bias. One limitation of the study is the assessment of drug use by

prescription data alone. The level of adherence to statin therapy
cannot be determined and neither can the precise date of initiation ofstatin treatment. Early discontinuation of statins due to side effects
could minimise the effect on the change in INR.
24Also, we had no
available information about other factors that might impact the INRlevel, eg lifestyle factors and herbal medications as well as relevant
diagnoses diagnosed solely in primary health care, but due to the
within-person comparison most of these factors can reasonably beassumed to be constant. Furthermore, we do not report clinical
outcomes. However, increases in INR are well known to increase the
risk of severe bleeding.
1,25,26This is supported by a study that found
initiation of statins to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding inchronic warfarin users.
27In our study the proportion of patients with
INR > 5 increased from 1.3 to 3.2% after statin treatment was
initiated. Importantly, however, when scrutinising the INR changes atthe level of the individual, this increase reflected a small overall
increase and not a pronounced increase in a subset of patients.
Finally, our study was limited to simvastatin, atorvastatin and
rosuvastatin. Limited use of other statins and other cholesterol
lowering therapy, eg the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe,
were not included in the present study. One study reported a possibledrug interaction between warfarin and
ezetimibe , which was
enhanced in patients taking both ezetimibe and statins with an
increase in INR (0.06 ± 0.36 for ezetimibe and 0.34 ± 0.54 forezetimibe and statins, P= 0.03).
28
Our findings from primary health care in the Copenhagen area
support the recent findings from specialised anticoagulation clinics in
Sweden presented by Andersson et al, which found an increase in INRfrom 2.43 to 2.58 in 5637 patients on warfarin treatment initiating
simvastatin, also peaking about 4 weeks after simvastatin initiation.
11
A more pronounced increase in INR was found in a small study in
which INR increased from 2.5 at baseline to 3.2 after simvastatin
initiation in 29 patients in stable warfarin treatment.8
Despite relying on different CYP enzymes and transporters, we
found a similar increase in INR values with use of simvastatin,atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. This suggests that non-CYP effects
might play a role in this drug-drug interaction. Also, the latency in the
INR increase, peaking after 4 weeks of concomitant treatment, issurprising. Of note, a similar course was seen in the study by
Andersson et al.
11This does not correspond to statins directly
inhibiting the CYP enzymes responsible for the metabolism ofwarfarin, as this would lead to a faster onset of the INR increase, eg,
as seen for azole antinfungals.
29To our knowledge, no alternative
mechanisms have been proposed. As such, additional work identifyingthe mechanism through which statin use potentiates the effect of
warfarin is warranted.
In conclusion, initiation of simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin
led to a minor increase in INR in patients treated with warfarin, peakingabout 4 weeks after statin initiation. The magnitude of the change in
INR is for most patients likely to be of limited clinical relevance.
Individual risk stratification including age, use of medication and otherdiseases should be applied when deciding if increased INR monitoring
should be performed during the initiation of statin treatment.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

APPENDIX A: THE INTERNATIONAL NORMALISED RATIO
ASSAY
Coagulation, tissue factor-induced; rel.time(actual/norm; INR; IRP
67/40; proc.) was determined in sodium-citrate-stabilised plasma byStago Prothombin-complex assay (Diagnostica Stago, Asnières,
France) on Thrombolyzer (Behnk Elektronik, Norderstedt, Germany)
and on STA-R (Diagnostica Stago). For the Thrombolyzer assay theinterserial coefficient of variation percentage (CV%) was 2.4% (at INR
level 1.0) and 2.9% (at INR level 2.3). For the STAR assay the
interserial CV% was 2.1% (at level INR 1.00) and 2.1% (at INR level2.2). The results from the two platforms were comparable as
documented by parallel analysis of 90 human plasma samples during a
period of 6 days in December 2001 to May 2002. The equation fromthe parallel analysis was STAR = 1.0186 ×Thrombolyzer −0.0305.
The STA-R platform was used after 8 December 2003. The INR assay
was subject to external quality control through participation in the
Danish quality assessment service (DEKS, Glostrup, Denmark). Theassessment schemes included five distributions annually. Each
distribution comprised four samples. The results from DEKS
confirmed the reliability of the assays, and the results from ELCR(from 2002 to 2015) deviated less than 5% from the method mean in
89% of the results (n = 231). The mean deviation from the method
mean was –1.8% (n = 196).698 ENGELL ET AL.
