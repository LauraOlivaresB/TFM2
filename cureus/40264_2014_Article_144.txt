Abstract Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used exten-
sively for the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders,
often over the long term, which raises the potential forclinically signiﬁcant drug interactions in patients receiving
concomitant medications. These drug–drug interactions
have been previously reviewed. However, the currentknowledge is likely to have advanced, so a thorough review
of the literature published since 2006 was conducted. This
identiﬁed new studies of drug interactions that are modu-lated by gastric pH. These studies showed the effect of a
PPI-induced increase in intragastric pH on mycophenolate
mofetil pharmacokinetics, which were characterised by adecrease in the maximum exposure and availability of
mycophenolic acid, at least at early time points. Post-2006
data were also available outlining the altered pharmaco-kinetics of protease inhibitors with concomitant PPI
exposure. New data for the more recently marketed dex-
lansoprazole suggest it has no impact on the pharmacoki-netics of diazepam, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin.
The CYP2C19-mediated interaction that seems to exist
between clopidogrel and omeprazole or esomeprazole has
been shown to be clinically important in research published
since the 2006 review; this effect is not seen as a classeffect of PPIs. Finally, data suggest that coadministration
of PPIs with methotrexate may affect methotrexate phar-
macokinetics, although the mechanism of interaction is notwell understood. As was shown in the previous review,
individual PPIs differ in their propensities to interact with
other drugs and the extent to which their interaction pro-ﬁles have been deﬁned. The interaction proﬁles ofomeprazole and pantoprazole sodium (pantoprazole-Na)
have been studied most extensively. Several studies have
shown that omeprazole carries a considerable potential fordrug interactions because of its high afﬁnity for CYP2C19
and moderate afﬁnity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantop-
razole-Na appears to have lower potential for interactionswith other medications. Lansoprazole and rabeprazole also
seem to have a weaker potential for interactions than
omeprazole, although their interaction proﬁles, along withthose of esomeprazole and dexlansoprazole, have been less
extensively investigated. Only a few drug interactions
involving PPIs are of clinical signiﬁcance. Nonetheless, thepotential for drug interactions should be considered when
choosing a PPI to manage gastric acid-related disorders.
This is particularly relevant for elderly patients takingmultiple medications, or for those receiving a concomitant
medication with a narrow therapeutic index.
1 Introduction
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) achieve a greater degree and
longer duration of gastric acid suppression, and better
healing rates in various gastric acid-related disorders, thanhistamine H
2receptor antagonists [ 1–3]. They are thus
considered essential in the management of gastro-oesoph-
ageal reﬂux disease, peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and Zol-linger–Ellison syndrome. PPIs are also a key part of triple
therapy (with two antibiotics, such as clarithromycin,
amoxicillin or metronidazole) for the eradication of H.
pylori in PUD [ 4], and may be used in the prophylaxis of
stress- and NSAID-induced PUD [ 5,6]. Many of these
disorders generally require long-term treatment, whichincreases the potential for clinically signiﬁcant drug
interactions in patients (such as hospitalised patients andR.-S. Wedemeyer ( &)/C1H. Blume

and other medications [ 9].
A previous review published in 2006 highlighted the
similarities and differences among the PPIs in terms of thelikelihood, relevance and mechanisms of drug–drug
interactions [ 10]. In the review, the authors discussed how,
by elevating pH, PPIs can modify the intragastric releaseof other drugs from their dosage forms, and also how PPIs
inﬂuence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting
with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein or
with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system [ 10]. At
the time of the review, the interaction proﬁles of ome-prazole and pantoprazole sodium (pantoprazole-Na) had
been studied most extensively. The authors concluded that
omeprazole carried a considerable potential for druginteractions because of its high afﬁnity for CYP2C19 and
moderate afﬁnity for CYP3A4, whereas pantoprazole-Na
appeared to have a lower potential for interactions thanomeprazole based on extensive evidence. Lansoprazole
and rabeprazole also seemed to have a weaker potential
for interactions than omeprazole, but this was based onlimited evidence only. Much of the review remains rele-
vant today; however, several PPI drug interaction papers
have been published since 2006. Thus, here we present anupdate of the 2006 review, which, when read in con-
junction with the original article, provides a comprehen-
sive overview of drug interactions associated with the useof PPIs [ 10].
This review is based on literature published from 1
January 2007 to 31 December 2012 identiﬁed by searching(i) MEDLINE using Medical Subject Heading (MESH)
terms for ‘drug-interactions’ and ‘proton pump inhibitors’;
and (ii) EMBASE using (Omeprazole/drug interaction) OR(Esomeprazole/drug interaction) OR (Lansoprazole/drug
interaction) OR (Pantoprazole/drug interaction) OR (Rab-
eprazole/drug interaction) OR (Proton-Pump-Inhibitor/drug interaction). Searches were limited to English lan-
guage and excluded comments, editorials, letters, notes or
conference papers or reviews. PUBMED and EMBASEresults were combined and duplicates removed; the
remaining results were divided into articles investigating
PPI interactions with clopidogrel (where this term was usedin the title, abstract or as CAS number for MEDLNE or as
descriptor for EMBASE) and other drug interaction arti-
cles. Additional articles were also obtained from manualsearches of the reference lists of relevant reviews and
papers. In total, 132 articles for interactions with clopido-
grel and 174 articles for interactions with other drugs wereobtained. The two authors independently selected addi-
tional articles for inclusion based on appropriate study
design for drug-interaction studies, and any discrepancieswere discussed and agreed. Forty new references were
identiﬁed and used in this updated review.2 Mechanisms Involved in Proton Pump Inhibitor
Drug Interactions
2.1 Modulation of Gastric pHGroup-speciﬁc interactions between PPIs and other drugs
may result from a PPI-induced increase in gastric pH,which can decrease the soluble amount of other drug
substances, alter drug release from products with pH-
dependent dissolution properties, or indirectly impact bio-availability by changing the kinetics of pro-drugs. Exam-
ples of drug pharmacokinetics that are affected by gastric
pH have been discussed extensively in the 2006 review[10]. These include the reduced bioavailability of oral
ketoconazole when co-administered with omeprazole
60 mg [ 11], and the reduced mean area under the con-
centration-time curve at 24 hours (AUC
24) and peak
plasma concentration ( Cmax) of oral itraconazole 200-mg
capsules administered with concomitant omeprazole 40 mg[12].
Of importance since the publication of the 2006 review,
new data are available for the interaction of PPIs andmycophenolate mofetil. Administration of PPIs increases
intragastric pH, which slows down the hydrolysis of my-
cophenolate mofetil resulting in decreased maximumexposure and availability of mycophenolic acid, at least at
early time points. Compared with mycophenolate mofetil
alone, coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with
pantoprazole-Na resulted in persistently lower plasma
concentrations of mycophenolic acid in heart transplantrecipients [ 13] and a signiﬁcant decrease in total and
maximum exposure in patients with autoimmune disease.
This correlated with a 42 % increase ( p\0.01) in the area
of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase activity [ 14].
However, coadministration of pantoprazole-Na and
enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium did not result in anysigniﬁcant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters in heart
or lung transplant recipients [ 15]. These ﬁndings from
steady-state studies conﬁrmed results from an earlier studyin healthy individuals [ 16]. Being in steady state for pan-
toprazole-Na (40 mg/day) signiﬁcantly lowered total and
maximum exposure of mycophenolic acid after adminis-tration of mycophenolate mofetil, but had no relevant
effect after administration of enteric-coated mycophenolate
sodium. Other pharmacokinetic parameters were notaffected [ 16], suggesting that interaction on the enzymatic
level is unlikely.
Other interactions not discussed in the previous review
include changes in the contact of the PPIs themselves to the
gastric environment, which will change the exposure to the
PPI. This predominantly results from the instability of PPIsat low pH and makes administration of PPIs by means of
gastro-resistant formulations a necessity. Consistent with202 R.-S. Wedemeyer, H. Blumethis, concomitant intake of the prokinetic mosapride led to
increases of about 50 % in total and maximum exposure
after administration of rabeprazole, which was explained
by the increased transport time to the intestine [ 17]. These
results substantiated earlier results for the combination of
omeprazole and mosapride [ 18] and suggested that such an
interaction would also beneﬁt all other PPIs. However, thisexplanation does not address the fact that administration as
a gastro-resistant formulation means no contact of PPI and
gastric acid, suggesting that an undiscovered pharmacoki-
netic interaction with mosapride is also possible.
A group effect with clear clinical implications is
assumed for several protease inhibitors that can have sig-
niﬁcantly altered bioavailability if coadministered with
PPIs. For example, total and maximum exposure to single-dose atazanavir 400 mg was reduced by more than 90 %
when administered with lansoprazole 60 mg [ 19]. The loss
in solubility for atazanavir at increased pH values is con-sidered responsible for this effect, as a CYP-mediated
interaction is unlikely for this drug combination. For other
combinations, the situation may be more complex. Expo-sure to nelﬁnavir, which is comparably pH-dependently
soluble, was reduced at steady state after nelﬁnavir
1,250 mg twice daily for 4 days by about 35 % if coad-ministered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily for 4 days,
but terminal elimination and clearance remained unaltered
[20]. Nevertheless, nelﬁnavir is metabolised by CYP 2C19,
whose inhibition by omeprazole probably counteracts the
loss in exposure caused by solubility effects. This would
also explain the decrease in the metabolic ratio of the mainmetabolite and nelﬁnavir.
In contrast, total and maximum exposure to single-dose
raltegravir 400 mg are increased by a factor of 3 and 4,respectively, if administered with omeprazole 20 mg once
daily for 4 days [ 21]. Enzyme-based interactions are unli-
kely given the metabolic pathway of raltegravir; however,raltegravir has greatly increased solubility at increased pH
and is a substrate to P-glycoprotein, which is at least
modestly inhibited by omeprazole, both effects probablybeing synergistic. As shown here, in addition to possible
group effects of PPIs, individual interactions of each
compound remain possible and should be considered.
The situation for protease inhibitors becomes even more
complex with the common concomitant use of the booster
ritonavir. Ritonavir itself has better solubility at a lowerpH, boosts other protease inhibitors by inhibiting CYP3A4,
is metabolised by CYP3A4 (similar to PPIs) and is a sub-
strate and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein [ 22–24].
Total and maximum exposure of the non-ionizable
lopinavir and ritonavir at steady state were both increased
by about 25 % when administered with omeprazole,without obvious changes in the elimination [ 22]. These
ﬁndings were explained by an increase in exposure toritonavir resulting from inhibition of P-glycoprotein by
omeprazole and a subsequent stronger inhibitory effect on
CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Separation of protease inhibitor and
omeprazole administration by 2 hours in another studylargely prevented this effect; the increase in total and
maximum exposure to ritonavir after dose separation was
lowered from 14 to 3 % and from 16 to 8 %, respectively[23]. In contrast, exposure to concomitantly administered
saquinavir remained increased by 50–70 % and, thus, was
obviously not triggered by the change for ritonavir (i.e.,
another more systemic effect should account for this
effect). Consistent with this, in another study, the increasein exposure to ritonavir was negligible, but exposure to
saquinavir was increased by about 80 %, with a concomi-
tant increase of omeprazole dose [ 24].
The combined effect of several factors was demon-
strated in a study with a single dose of indinavir 800 mg, in
which exposure to indinavir was decreased by 35 and 45 %with constant treatment with omeprazole 20 and 40 mg but
was increased by 55 % when a single dose of ritonavir
200 mg was added to high-dose omeprazole [ 25].
2.2 Interactions with the Adenosine Triphosphate-
Dependent Efﬂux Transporter P-Glycoprotein
Since the publication of the previous review [ 10], there
have been no new studies involving PPIs and the P-gly-coprotein transporter system. In the previous review,
omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole-Na, which are
substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter system, wereall reported to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated efﬂux of
digoxin in an in vitro Caco-2 cell model [ 26]. Data were
not available in this study for esomeprazole andrabeprazole.
2.3 The Cytochrome P450 Enzyme SystemDiscussion of interactions with intestinal and liver CYPs
was extensive in the 2006 review [ 10] and is not reiterated
here, except to remind readers that PPIs are predominantly
metabolised in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 [ 27].
Of signiﬁcance since the previous review, there have
been extensive discussions in recent reviews and meta-
analyses on the drug interactions between certain PPIs and
clopidogrel [ 28–34]. These interactions appear to be
mediated by CYP2C19 and are of utmost clinical rele-
vance. Although recent retrospective studies have sug-
gested an attenuation of the beneﬁcial effects ofclopidogrel when administered concomitantly with PPIs in
general, stratiﬁcation of the analysis has indicated that such
effects are not present in patients receiving pantoprazole-Na compared with those receiving omeprazole [ 35,36].
Several studies demonstrated that being in steady state forDrug Interactions with Proton Pump Inhibitors 203omeprazole signiﬁcantly increased total exposure to clop-
idogrel and decreased exposure to the active metabolite
[37]. These effects continued to persist even after sepa-
rating administrations of the drugs by 12 hours, or afteradministration of doubled doses of clopidogrel. However,
differences became clearly smaller after substitution of
omeprazole by pantoprazole-Na [ 37].
This is consistent with the ﬁnding that clopidogrel must
be activated by CYP2C19, an enzyme inhibited by ome-
prazole but not pantoprazole-Na [ 38]. It is further
conﬁrmed by data showing that exposure to the active
metabolite after administration of clopidogrel was signiﬁ-cantly decreased, and inhibition of platelet function
diminished, under coadministration of omeprazole or
esomeprazole [ 39]. The relevance of CYP2C19 is further
stressed by a study showing that only a small effect was
observed from coadministration of lansoprazole with
prasugrel, the latter being activated more dominantly byCYP isoenzymes other than CYP2C19 [ 40].
The situation for lansoprazole seems more complex;
however, unlike for rabeprazole, at least some information,including pharmacokinetic data, is available. Coadminis-
tration of lansoprazole with clopidogrel had no effect on
the formation of clopidogrel’s inactive carboxylic acidmetabolite. Nonetheless, the pharmacodynamic effect was
signiﬁcantly lowered in good responders to clopidogrel,
probably as a result of inhibition of clopidogrel activationvia CYP2C19, which is without relevance for the formation
of the carboxylic acid derivative via esterases [ 40]. How-
ever, evaluation of the total population in this study did notshow more than a trend to a lowered efﬁcacy of clopido-
grel. This is consistent with ﬁndings reported from another
study which found lansoprazole or dexlansoprazoleexhibited no signiﬁcant effect on the exposure to clopido-
grel’s active metabolite or its pharmacodynamics [ 39].
In summary an interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs
seems to exist for omeprazole and esomeprazole, whereas
there are only limited data for rabeprazole. Dexlansopraz-
ole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole-Na had less effect onthe antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel than did omeprazole
or esomeprazole, which is supported by the Plavix
label [ 41].
3 Interaction Proﬁles of Proton Pump Inhibitors
The interaction proﬁles of omeprazole and pantoprazole-
Na have been extensively studied, whereas those foresomeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole are less well
deﬁned. The major ﬁndings of these studies are summa-
rised in Table 1, which includes new data on drug
interaction studies with bortezomib [ 42], ciproﬂoxacin
extended release [ 43], citalopram [ 44], clarithromycin [ 45],clopidogrel [ 37,39], etravirine [ 46], gemiﬂoxacin [ 47] and
ivabradine [ 48].
Since 2006, a retrospective case-control study in
patients with coronary artery disease indicated increasedresidual platelet aggregation and platelet activation during
concomitant treatment with 75 mg/day non-enteric-coated
acetylsalicylic acid and PPIs [ 49]. Coadministration of
enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid with pantoprazole-Na
showed a decrease in platelet aggregation [ 50] and coad-
ministration with lansoprazole showed no signiﬁcant effect
on platelet activity or in the levels of salicylates in the
blood [ 51]. Thus, these prospective studies, which inves-
tigated the effects of the PPIs constituting concomitant
treatment in about 70 % of patients in the case-control
study, do not support the observed impairment of acetyl-salicylic acid. Effects on platelet function with omeprazole
and esomeprazole cannot be ruled out and monitoring of
treatment efﬁcacy might be recommended in cases ofomeprazole or esomeprazole coadministration.
Case reports (from both the literature and the US Food
and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting Sys-tem) along with population pharmacokinetic studies sug-
gest that coadministration of PPIs and methotrexate may
elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its
metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, although the mechanism
for this interaction is not clearly understood (see Bezabeh
et al. [ 52] for a comprehensive review).
3.1 Omeprazole
In the previous review [ 10], omeprazole was reported to
interact with diazepam [ 53–55], proguanil [ 56] and the
antidepressant moclobemide (in extensive metabolisers)[57] via competitive inhibition of CYP2C19. Omeprazole-
induced competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 also has the
potential to alter the metabolism of phenytoin [ 54,58] and
warfarin [ 59–63] (see the previous review for an extensive
discussion) [ 10]. More recently, CYP2C19 inhibition by
omeprazole was identiﬁed as the reason for a 50 %reduction in the oral clearance of ( ?)-(S) citalopram, with a
corresponding increase of approximately 120 % in plasma
concentrations in healthy volunteers [ 44]. Similarly, such
inhibition was found most likely to increase the total
exposure of etravirine by 41 % after a single dose of
etravirine 100 mg and multiple-dose omeprazole, an effectthat was not observed with multiple-dose ranitidine [ 46].
The effects of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of
antacids, bortezomib, ciproﬂoxacin extended release,gemiﬂoxacin, nifedipine, metoprolol, NSAIDs, iron and
theophylline have also been investigated, with no clini-
cally signiﬁcant ﬁndings [ 42,43,47,64–69]. Systematic
clinical trials have shown conﬂicting results for interac-
tions between omeprazole and ciclosporin, with elevated204 R.-S. Wedemeyer, H. BlumeTable 1 Pharmacokinetic interaction proﬁles of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

Compounds with a high afﬁnity for CYP3A4 (e.g.,
ketoconazole or ﬂuconazole [ 72,73], clarithromycin [ 74]
and moclobemide [ 75]) may affect the bioavailability of
omeprazole by increasing its serum concentrations, but thisis only likely to be clinically relevant in those with
CYP2C19 deﬁciency who metabolise omeprazole via the
CYP3A4 metabolic pathway.
Omeprazole kinetics are also affected via the CYP2C19
pathway. Decreased plasma concentrations of omeprazoleand omeprazole sulphone occurred after administration of
ginkgo biloba [ 76] or St. John’s wort [ 77]. Metabolism of
omeprazole was reduced following administration of ﬂu-voxamine (extensive metabolisers only) [ 78], and the
omeprazole AUC was increased following use of a com-
bined oral contraceptive containing ethinyloestradiol [ 79]
(see previous review for details [ 10]).
In summary, several omeprazole-related drug interac-
tions have been reported, although not all these interactionsare considered signiﬁcant. The number of reported inter-
actions might be explained by the fact that omeprazole has
been available longer than other PPIs (since 1989).
3.2 Esomeprazole
There are no additional new data for CYP-mediated
interactions with esomeprazole. The 2006 review con-
cluded that the interaction potentials of esomeprazole andracemic omeprazole seem not to differ signiﬁcantly [ 10].
The authors reported that there were no apparent interac-
tions between esomeprazole and drugs that are primarilymetabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or
CYP2E1 [ 80]. Esomeprazole, however, does interact with
compounds metabolised by CYP2C19 as shown in studiesusing phenytoin and R-warfarin, although interactions did
not reach clinical signiﬁcance [ 80]. In addition, multiple
doses of esomeprazole increased diazepam concentrationsand reduced diazepam elimination, but no similar changes
were reported with pantoprazole-Na [ 81,82]. These effects
with esomeprazole were manifested clinically as disruptedmotor coordination and vigilance [ 81,82].
3.3 PantoprazoleSince the last review, pantoprazole-Na has been shown to
have no signiﬁcant interactions with clopidogrel [ 37]. The
authors of the previous review concluded that extensive
studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown
that pantoprazole-Na has a low potential to interact withother medications [ 10]. There were no signiﬁcant meta-
bolic interactions when combining pantoprazole-Na withantacids [ 83], phenazone (antipyrine) [ 84], caffeine [ 85],
carbamazepine [ 86], cinacalcet [ 87], clarithromycin [ 45],
ciclosporin [ 88], clopidogrel [ 37], diazepam [ 89], diclofe-
nac [ 90],b-acetyldigoxin [ 91], ethanol [ 92], glibenclamide
[93], levothyroxine sodium [ 94], metoprolol [ 95], naproxen
[96], sustained-release nifedipine [ 97], oral contraceptives
[98], phenprocoumon [ 99], phenytoin [ 100], piroxicam
[101], tacrolimus [ 102], theophylline [ 103] or warfarin
[104]. There was a slight, but clinically insigniﬁcant,
interaction between pantoprazole-Na 40 mg and cisapride
20 mg [ 105].
Pantoprazole-magnesium (pantoprazole-Mg) is an
improved formulation of pantoprazole that has been
developed since the 2006 review. Pantoprazole-Mg was
achieved by synthesizing a magnesium salt of the activeingredient, rather than a sodium salt as in pantoprazole-Na.
Since pantoprazole-Na and pantoprazole-Mg are different
salts of the same molecule, their drug interaction proﬁlesare expected to be similar.
3.4 LansoprazoleThere have been no new CYP-mediated drug interaction
studies with lansoprazole since the 2006 review [ 10]. As
outlined previously, there are no clinically signiﬁcant
interactions reported between lansoprazole and phenazone
[106], diazepam [ 107], ivabradine [ 48], magaldrate [ 108],
oral contraceptives [ 109], phenytoin [ 110], prednisolone
[111], propranolol [ 111] or warfarin [ 112]. Increases in
theophylline bioavailability following lansoprazoleadministration are not considered to be clinically signiﬁ-
cant [ 113,114], and increased clearance of theophylline
following lansoprazole use [ 115] was not seen consistently
[113]. Lansoprazole decreased oral tacrolimus clearance,
signiﬁcantly increasing blood tacrolimus concentration
[116], particularly in those with CYP2C19 mutant alleles
[116,117]. Finally, the CYP2C19 inhibitor ﬂuvoxamine
had a signiﬁcant effect on lansoprazole metabolism
(increased plasma concentrations) in extensive metabolis-ers for CYP2C19 but not in poor metabolisers [ 118].
More recently, dexlansoprazole, the active enantiomer
of lansoprazole, has been introduced into therapy. This
compound is marketed with an innovative Dual Delayed
ReleaseTMtechnology, which is designed to release the
entire dose in two separate portions to allow prolongationof plasma concentration-time proﬁles after once-daily
administration. Considering the mechanism of action of
PPI with irreversible inhibition of the proton pump, clinicaladvantages of such a biopharmaceutical proﬁle should be
carefully evaluated in therapeutic practice. Interactions
of dexlansoprazole dual delayed release product havebeen investigated with diazepam, phenytoin, theophylline
and warfarin as probe drugs (for interactions, e.g. with206 R.-S. Wedemeyer, H. BlumeCYP2C19, 2C9, 1A2 and 3A) and no impact on pharma-
cokinetics of the compounds has been found [ 119].
The interaction proﬁles of lansoprazole and dexlansop-
razole have not been as thoroughly investigated as those ofomeprazole or pantoprazole-Na. Nonetheless, neither
compound appears to be associated with major clinically
relevant drug interactions.
3.5 RabeprazoleInformation on drug interactions with rabeprazole has not
changed since the 2006 review [ 10]. Drug interactions with
rabeprazole are less well studied than those with omepra-
zole or pantoprazole-Na, as evidenced by the large number
of unknown results in Table 1. Most studies report inter-
actions attributed to the group effect of all PPIs on gastric
pH (e.g. interactions with digoxin [ 120] or ketoconazole
[121]). Signiﬁcant CYP-mediated drug interactions with
rabeprazole are generally not likely because rabeprazole
has a low afﬁnity for a range of CYP isoenzymes [ 27].
Further studies will prove useful to conﬁrm this. In the2006 review, rabeprazole was not found to be involved in
metabolic drug interactions with theophylline [ 121], war-
farin [ 121], phenytoin [ 120], tacrolimus [ 122] or antacids
[123]. Its effect on the pharmacokinetics of the desmethyl
metabolite of diazepam was signiﬁcant only in poor met-
abolisers of S-mephenytoin 4
0-hydroxylation (i.e., those
deﬁcient in CYP2C19) [ 55].
The CYP2C19 inhibitor ﬂuvoxamine had a signiﬁcant
effect on rabeprazole metabolism in extensive metabolisersof CYP2C19, with increased AUC
(0,?)and elimination
half-life of rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether in
homozygous and heterozygous extensive metabolisers[124]. In contrast, there were no differences in any phar-
macokinetic parameters in poor metabolisers (*2/*2).
4 Conclusions
A thorough review of the literature since 2006 has yielded
additional PPI drug interactions modulated by gastric pH,
such as those reported with mycophenolate mofetil [ 13,14,
16], the instability of PPIs themselves at low pH [ 17], and
the altered pharmacokinetics of several protease inhibitors
(including atazanavir [ 19], nelﬁnavir [ 20], raltegravir [ 21],
ritonavir [ 22–24], and indinavir [ 25]). There are, however,
a few new CYP-mediated drug interaction studies, with the
most notable being the new data on dexlansoprazole anddata for interactions between some PPIs and clopidogrel.
Of clinical importance in recent years, CYP2C19-mediated
interaction seems to exist between clopidogrel and ome-prazole or esomeprazole, an effect not seen in PPIs as a
class [ 35–37,39]. In addition, the effects of omeprazoleand esomeprazole on platelet aggregation when coadmin-
istered with acetylsalicylic acid cannot be ruled out without
additional research. Finally, coadministration of PPIs with
methotrexate may affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics,although the mechanism of interaction is not well under-
stood [ 52].
Overall, the conclusions from the 2006 review still
remain relevant. Lansoprazole, pantoprazole-Na and rab-
eprazole appear to be associated with lower incidences of
drug interactions than omeprazole and esomeprazole,
resulting either from their lower afﬁnity for speciﬁc CYP
isoenzymes or the involvement of additional eliminationprocesses. However, only the interaction proﬁle of pan-
toprazole-Na has been well characterised.
With little difference among the PPIs in terms of clinical
efﬁcacy at equivalent doses, differences in drug interaction
propensities become important factors in prescribing
decisions, particularly in patients who are taking multipleconcomitant medications (such as the elderly) or those
receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. A PPI
with a well proven low risk of drug interactions would bethe favourable choice in these patients.
