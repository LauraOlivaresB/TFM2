Abstract
Here we characterize and summarize the pharmacokinetic changes for metabolized drugs when 
drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenomic variance is observed. Following multiple dosing to 
steady-state, oral systemic concentration-time curves appear to follow a one-compartment body 
model, with a shorter rate limiting half-life, often significantly shorter than the single dose 
terminal half-life. This simplified disposition model at steady-state allows comparisons of 
measurable parameters (i.e., area under the curve, half-life, maximum concentration and time to 
maximum concentration) following drug interaction or pharmacogenomic variant studies to be 
utilized to characterize whether a drug is low versus high hepatic extraction ratio, even without 
intravenous dosing. The characteristics of drugs based on the ratios of area under the curve, 
maximum concentration and half-life are identified with recognition that volume of distribution is 
essentially unchanged for drug interaction and pharmacogenomic variant studies where only 
metabolic outcomes are changed and transporters are not significantly involved. Comparison of 
maximum concentration changes following single dose interaction and pharmacogenomic variance 
studies may also identify the significance of intestinal first pass changes. The irrelevance of 
protein binding changes on pharmacodynamic outcomes following oral and intravenous dosing of 
low hepatic extraction ratio drugs, versus its relevance for high hepatic extraction ratio drugs is re-
emphasized.

Recently we derived the theoretical basis for the extended clearance model of organ 
elimination following both oral and intravenous dosing and critically analyzed the 
approaches previously taken [ 1]. Here in this special issue of the Journal honoring our friend 
and colleague, Professor Panos Macheras, we extend these analyses to understand and 
emphasize specific applications of these concepts, reflecting the approach taken by Professor

The Importance of Changes or Lack of Change in Volume of Distribution
As our laboratory has pointed out [ 1, 2], drug-drug interactions and changes in disposition 
related to pharmacogenomic (PG) variance can potentially lead to changes in volume of 
distribution when transporters more than minimally affect drug disposition. V olume of 
distribution changes will not impede the ability to accurately predict changes in exposure 
(AUC , area under the systemic concentration-time curve) when transporters are involved. 
However, if both clearance and volume of distribution change as a result of transporters 
being significantly involved in a drug-drug interaction or as a result of a PG variance, it will 
be difficult to predict and understand the time-course of drug concentrations resulting from 
the modification, since mean residence time ( MRT  ) is directly related to volume of 
distribution ( Vss, volume of distribution steady-state) and inversely related to clearance 
(CL), as shown in Eq. 1 [ 3].
MRT =Vss
CL(1)
We use MRT  here rather than half-life to obviate the necessity of discussing 
multicompartment systems.
Single Dose Terminal Half-life vs. Operational Half-life at Steady State
It is important to note that many interactions are clinically relevant for drugs upon multiple 
dosing at steady-state, and as pointed out by Sahin and Benet [ 4], the elimination half-life of 
this steady-state disposition model will be less (and often markedly less) than the terminal 
half-life observed following a single dose. This is because at steady-state, distribution has 
less impact on the concentration time-course, and therefore a simple one-compartment 
disposition model can be used.
We illustrate this difference in single vs. multiple dosing half-life in Fig. 1, where Fig. 1A 
depicts the logarithmic concentration-time curve following a single 100 mg oral dose of a 
low hepatic extraction drug with the following two compartment body model parameters: 
volume of the central compartment ( V1) is 100 L, the rate constant of elimination from the 
central compartment ( k10 ) is 0.1 hr−1, the distribution rate constants into and out of the 
peripheral compartment ( k12 and k 21 ) are 0.06 hr−1and 0.08 hr−1, respectively (resulting in 
two-compartment exponential functions of λ1 = 0.2 hr−1 and λ2 = 0.04 hr−1), an hepatic 
clearance of 10 L/hr, a first order absorption rate constant ( ka) of 1.0 hr−1 and a 
bioavailability ( F ) of 0.8 when FA·FG (as defined below) is 0.9. The equation describing this 
single oral dose concentration-time course is:
C= 0.750   e−0.20  t+ 0.208   e−0.04  t− 0.958   e−1.00  t(2)Benet et al. Page 2
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAnd the resulting single dose terminal half-life is 17.3 hr. Above the single dose curve in 
Fig. 1A, we depict the concentration-time curve at steady-state where the 100 mg oral dose 
is given every 12 hr. It is obvious in Fig. 1A that the concentration-time curves during a 
dosing interval at steady-state approximate a one-compartment body model, since with 
multiple dosing and accumulation the peripheral compartment becomes fuller and less 
distribution is evident, with a half-life that appears to be between 8.5 and 9 hr. As pointed 
out by Sahin and Benet [ 4], it is the multiple dosing operational half-life that predicts 
accumulation, with no evidence that the 17.3 hr terminal half-life is relevant.
Considerations of Metabolic (vs. Transporter) Drug-Drug Interactions and 
PG Variance
Changes in drug metabolism related to drug interactions or PG variance have the potential to 
alter drug clearance, but not via any changes in transporter function. Therefore, it is expected 
that volume of distribution of drug should remain unchanged. Although we have not 
exhaustively analyzed the drug-drug interaction and PG variance database, we are not aware 
of any changes in drug volume of distribution that result from metabolic changes only. 
Further, changes in renal or biliary elimination are not expected, as they frequently are 
affected by transporters. Thus, the present analysis assumes that for metabolism-related 
changes resulting from drug interactions or PG variance there are no changes in volume of 
distribution, renal clearance or biliary clearance. Therefore, MRT  and steady-state half-life 
are inversely related to clearance, and any observed changes in exposure ( AUC ), maximum 
concentration following an oral dose ( Cmax) and half-life result from metabolic changes 
only. The equations for AUC  will all be analyzed assuming that the hepatic extraction ratio 
is determined as the ratio of hepatic blood clearance to hepatic blood flow as we recently 
reviewed [ 5], so that hepatic first pass bioavailability following oral dosing ( FH) is given by 
Eq. 3:
FH= 1 −CLH
QH(3)
where CLH is the hepatic metabolic blood clearance and QH is the hepatic blood flow.
Exposure Following Oral Dosing and Impact on Pharmacodynamics
As shown in our recent publication [ 1] and by many others
AUC oral=FA⋅FG⋅D
fu,B⋅ ∑CLint(4)
where FA is the fraction of the dose absorbed, FG is the fraction of the dose escaping 
intestinal metabolism, D is dose, fu,B is the fraction of unbound drug in blood calculated as 
the fraction unbound in plasma divided by the blood to plasma concentration ratio, and 
∑CLint is the sum of the irreversible elimination intrinsic clearances from the liver. 
Equation 4 is applicable to all oral dosing conditions where only metabolism is considered 
and volume of distribution is a constant. That is, Eq. 4 is valid for high hepatic extraction Benet et al. Page 3
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript(ERH), intermediate and low ERH drugs. Thus, the exposure following oral dosing will 
change inversely with ∑CLint and fu,B and directly with FA · FG.
Exposure following oral dosing can also be markedly affected by changes in FG though 
inhibition, induction and/or genomic variance of intestinal enzymes. This will be particularly 
true for CYP3A substrates, since CYP3A4 is the major enzyme present in the intestinal 
epithelia. As will be addressed subsequently, the importance of FG in changes of exposure 
following a single oral dose can be approximated by comparing the changes in AUC  and 
Cmax to the changes in half-life or MRT .
Clinically relevant changes, those where pharmacodynamics are altered, will be expected 
based on the extent of the exposure changes resulting from drug-drug interactions and PG 
variance. However pharmacodynamic changes will not be observed when total drug AUC 
varies due to fu,B changes. As emphasized by Benet and Hoener [ 6], Eq. 5 shows that the 
area under the concentration-time curve for unbound drug ( AUC u) following oral dosing will 
be unaffected by changes in protein binding.
AUC u,oral=FA⋅FG⋅D
∑CLint(5)
It is also possible to derive the relationship for the exposure within the liver following oral 
dosing ( AUC H,oral ) as given in Eq. 6:
AUC H,oral=FA⋅FG⋅D
fu,H⋅ ∑CLint(6)
where fu,H is the fraction of drug unbound within the liver. Again, one can see by 
multiplying through by fu,H that changes related to intrahepatic unbound drug concentrations 
will have no effect on a pharmacodynamic outcome.
Using AUC, Maximum Concentrations and Steady-State Half-Life to 
Characterize Extraction Ratio Following Oral Dosing
In understanding changes in pharmacokinetics for metabolized drugs, we concentrate on the 
ready measures that a clinician or scientist can observe following drug dosing. Following 
oral dosing, these include AUC , Cmax, half-life and tmax, the time when Cmax occurs. Most 
approved orally administered drugs have not been studied following intravenous dosing in 
humans and therefore as seen in Eq. 7, bioavailability ( F, which equals FA·FG·FH) cannot be 
distinguished from clearance.
D
AUC=CL
F(7)
However, drug interaction and pharmacogenomic variance studies can provide useful 
information as to whether a drug is a high ERH drug, where F is small, versus a low ERH Benet et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptdrug, where F approaches 1. As we demonstrate below, the analysis should consider AUC , 
Cmax and apparent half-life at steady-state.
The data described in Fig.1A represents a low ERH drug for which all elimination is via 
metabolism, where FH = 0.889 and FA·FG = 0.9, giving the F value of 0.8 for both single and 
multiple dosing. In Fig. 1B we depict the single dose oral concentration-time curve for a 
high ERH drug, keeping the dose, FA·FG , distribution, elimination and absorption rate 
constants unchanged, but hepatic clearance increased to 70 L/ hr and V 1 to 700 L. Above the 
single dose curve in Fig. 1B we depict the concentration time curve for every 12 hour 
dosing. Here again the terminal half-life following oral dosing is 17.3 hr and the half-life for 
steady-state dosing appears to be approximately 8 hr.
Obviously, we could have chosen an infinite set of parameters to define the low and high 
extraction ratio drugs depicted in Figs. 1A and 1B, respectively, but to allow comparison of 
the effects of inhibition and induction on low versus high ERH drugs, we wanted to have 
control conditions and half-lives that were approximately the same.
Inhibition, Induction and Pharmacogenomic Variance Outcomes Following 
Oral Dosing
In Figs. 1C and 1D we depict the concentration time curves when metabolism is inhibited, 
clearance is decreased by 50%, for the low and high ERH drugs, respectively. When 
metabolism is inhibited, for the low ERH drug, CLH = 5 L/hr, which results in F becoming 
0.85. For the high ERH drug CLH = 35 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.55.
In Fig.1E we depict the concentration time curves when enzyme induction has occurred and 
have doubled the hepatic clearance of the low ERH drug to 20 L/hr, which results in F 
becoming 0.70. In Fig. 1F we have increased the hepatic clearance of the high ERH drug to 
80 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.1. It is obvious that the terminal half-life of the drug 
in each single dose plot is markedly different from the apparent one-compartment half-lives 
upon multiple dosing as noted in the figure legend.
Table 1 summarizes the ratios of the various parameters for the altered condition (either 
decreased-inhibited or increased-induced metabolism) relative to the control condition for 
both low and high ERH drugs. The AUC  ratio will be the same for the first dose and at 
steady-state, since the single dose AUC 0→∞ is equal to the multiple dose steady-state 
AUC 0→τ, during a dosing interval τ. The half-life value ratios reported in Table 1A are the 
multiple dosing values, the operational multiple dosing half-life, t½op, defined by Sahin and 
Benet [ 4]. The Cmax ratios in Table 1A are for steady-state values ( Cmax,ss ).
A very useful relationship is observed when comparing the AUC , Cmax,ss  and t½op ratios. 
For low ERH drugs, these three ratios are approximately the same for inhibited conditions 
and for induced conditions. In contrast, for high ERH drugs, the AUC  and Cmax,ss  ratios are 
approximately the same but markedly different from the t½op ratios. Thus, even without IV 
dosing it is possible from these interaction or PG variance studies to learn whether a drug is 
high or low ERH. The marked difference in the operational half-life ratios versus AUC  and Benet et al. Page 5
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptCmax ratios for high versus low ERH drugs is primarily due to the relative magnitude of 
change possible in FH for high versus low ERH drugs. For low ERH drugs marked changes 
in clearance will have minimal impact on FH (as evident in Eq. 3) and therefore on overall F. 
Since AUC  and Cmax can be influenced by changes in both clearance and F, and F is 
expected to be relatively unchanged for low ERH drugs, it follows that changes in half-life 
related to clearance changes will be similar in magnitude to AUC  and Cmax changes. For 
high ERH drugs, a small change in hepatic clearance can lead to a marked change in FH (and 
therefore AUC  and Cmax ) much larger in magnitude than the observed change in half-life. 
Additionally, on a percentage basis for high ERH drugs a marked increase in clearance may 
not be possible, since clearance already approaches hepatic blood flow. Further, with a 
marked decrease in the hepatic clearance of a high ERH compound, the drug would no 
longer be high ERH.
Table 1B summarizes less definitive ratios, but some interesting outcomes should be noted. 
For a low ERH drug, inhibition yields little change in Cmax for a single dose study. This is 
true, since although AUC  is the same for the first dose and the steady-state dosing interval, 
Cmax accumulates during multiple dosing and little effect is seen for a single dose. In 
contrast for a high ERH drug, there will be an observable first dose increase in Cmax with 
inhibition, but not as much as the increase in AUC . Although mathematically we can 
calculate the first dose changes in Cmax due to induction, and experimental studies can be 
designed to evaluate this ratio, this will not be useful in a relevant study or clinical situation 
since there will be little induction following the first dose of a concomitant inducer, and by 
the time induction has occurred, the subjects will be at steady-state. However, the first dose 
effect can be analyzed for increased PG metabolism. The Cmin,ss  values do show 
differentiation between high and low ERH drugs for inhibition and induction, however, the 
disadvantage is that there is no further confirming comparison as in the case of the Cmax,ss 
ratios. The advantage of analyzing the Cmax,ss  ratios is that they should be similar to the 
AUC  ratios in discriminating high and low ERH drugs. It will also be very difficult to make 
any conclusions based on tmax ratios either at steady-state or from a single dose inhibition 
study, since all of the ratio values are so close to 1.0. However, we will always expect the 
multiple dosing tmax to be smaller in magnitude than the single dose tmax for all situations. 
Similar to the t½op ratios, the change in terminal half-life following a single dose will show 
the appropriate inhibition/induction effects, but it is often more difficult to determine these 
terminal half-life values versus the apparent t½op values at steady-state. Yet, following single 
dose drug interaction or pharmacogenomic variance studies, high versus low ERH can be 
discerned. Comparing AUC  ratios with t½term,1st dose  in Table 1 shows that the t½term,1st dose 
ratio approximates the AUC  ratio for both inhibition and induction with low ERH drugs, but 
not as close as the t½,op ratio (i.e., Inhibition, Low ERH: AUC  ratio 2.13, t½term,1st dose  ratio 
1.67, t½,op ratio 1.95; Inhibition High ERH: AUC  ratio 5.50, t½term,1st dose  ratio 1.67, t½,op 
ratio 2.20; Induction, Low ERH: AUC  ratio 0.44, t½term,1st dose  ratio 0.71, t½,op ratio 0.53; 
Induction, High ERH: AUC  ratio 0.44, t½term,1st dose  ratio 0.82, t½,op ratio 0.80). One can 
readily see that high vs low ERH can be determined following the single dose studies.Benet et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptCYP3A Substrates Following Oral Dosing
Since CYP3A is the major cytochrome P450 enzyme in the intestine, inhibition or induction 
of this enzyme can have major effects on FG. This results in greater effects on AUC  and 
Cmax ratios than for non-CYP3A substrates, but with essentially no additional effect on t½ 
ratios. For CYP3A inhibition studies, we expect there to be less differential between the first 
dose and steady-state Cmax ratios.
Inhibition, Induction and Pharmacogenomic Variance Outcomes Following 
IV Dosing
There are many fewer drug interaction (inhibition and induction) and PG variance 
(decreased and increased metabolism) data following IV dosing than for oral dosing. 
However, some general rules can be applied. For low ERH drugs, changes in AUC  and half-
life will be similar to that for oral drugs, but of course, there will be no F related issues. For 
high ERH drugs, AUC  and half-life will change inversely with QH. Protein binding 
interactions will change pharmacodynamic effects. That is, if there is more free drug, a 
greater effect will be observed, in contrast to the lack of a pharmacodynamic effect for orally 
dosed drugs and low ERH IV dosed drugs [ 1].
Comparison of Pharmacokinetics in Disease State Patients vs Healthy 
Volunteers
The analysis presented here for analyzing pharmacokinetic changes in metabolic outcome 
due to inhibition, induction and PG variance assumes that volume of distribution remains 
constant, which we maintain is the condition for metabolic drug interactions and PG 
variance. As noted above if transporters are significantly involved the general trends 
discussed here may not be appropriate since transporter changes can also lead to volume of 
distribution changes in addition to clearance changes, both of which will affect half-lives. 
This may also be true for comparison of disease state versus healthy volunteer analysis, 
where the disease state may potentially change volume of distribution beyond simply 
changing the extent of protein binding. However, as seen below for propranolol, this does 
not appear to be a disqualifying situation.
Examples of Metabolic Drug Interactions and Pharmacogenomic Variance 
from the Literature
Alván et al. [ 7] reported the induction of alprenolol metabolism by pentobarbital treatment 
as depicted for one subject in Fig. 2. Subjects received oral (200 mg) and IV (5 mg) 
alprenolol, a high ERH drug with a plasma clearance of 75 ± 10 L/hr (blood to plasma ratio 
not given), before and after 10 days of nightly 100 mg oral doses of pentobarbital. As would 
be expected, no significant change in AUC  or t½ was seen for the IV curves, since QH would 
not be expected to change with pentobarbital induction. However, there will be easily 
observable changes in AUC  and Cmax,ss  following oral dosing as per Eq. 4, and they are 
expected to change in parallel, as shown in Table 1A (High ERH , Induced). As shown in Benet et al. Page 7
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTable 1A, a decrease in t½ would also be expected, but the change would be much less than 
the AUC  and Cmax,ss  changes and not as obvious. This appears to be the case in Fig. 2.
Blake et al. [ 8] carried out a meta-analysis of single oral doses of metoprolol in extensive, 
poor, intermediate and ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers of this high ER drug. The 
comparison of the ratios of mean values for AUC , Cmax,1st dose  and terminal t½1st dose  are 
given in Table 2. As seen in comparison with Table 1 High ERH Inhibited, the AUC  ratio 
(Poor/Extensive) in Table 2 is more than double the Cmax,1st dose  ratio (4.86 vs 2.28) and the 
t½1st dose  ratio (4.86 vs 2.28). The AUC  ratio (Ultra-Rapid/Extensive) is less than the 
Cmax,1st dose  ratio (0.37 vs 0.43) and the t½1st dose  ratio (0.37 vs 0.90).These results follow 
the same pattern as the comparison in Table 1 for High ERH Induced. At steady state the 
AUC  and Cmax ratios would be expected to be similar, but this is not the case following the 
first dose, which are often the only data available when sponsors are characterizing the 
relevance of potential drug-drug interactions and the importance of pharmacogenomic 
variance.
Kharasch et al. [ 9] investigated the effects of CYP2B6 polymorphisms on the 
pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous methadone, a low ERH drug. Only AUC 0→∞ 
values were reported together with figures depicting the average plasma concentration time 
curves. There was sufficient separation of the S-methadone plasma concentration curves that 
we were able to digitalize the data resulting in the outcomes presented in Table 3A for the 
measurements of relevance to this analysis. As can be seen, our calculated AUC 0→∞ values 
from the digitalized data are reasonably close to the published values, all within 7%. The 
ratios for the individual parameters we calculated from the digitalized data are presented in 
Table 3A. There are no significant differences between the normal metabolizers 
(CYP2B*1/*1) and the intermediate metabolizers (CYP2B*1/*6). However, poor 
metabolizers (CYP2B*6/*6) yield comparable ratios for AUC  and t½terminal,1st dose  as would 
be suspected for a low ERH drug following the pattern given in Table 1, with Cmax,1st dose 
not giving as big a change, again as reflected in Table 1 for inhibition of a low ERH drug. 
The intravenous plasma concentration values in Kharasch et al. [ 9], corrected for a blood/
plasma ratio of 0.79 [ 10] yield a blood clearance of 17.0 L/hr for S-methadone, consistent 
with a low ERH drug.
There were only 4 rapid metabolizers in the study for two different genotypes as given in 
Table 3, and their average blood clearance was 27.2 L/hr, approaching a doubling. The ratios 
of AUC  and t½terminal,1st dose  are quite similar to the values in Table 1 for a two-fold 
induction in clearance for a low extraction ratio drug, but the Cmax,1st dose  ratio is lower than 
expected. This could be due to the limited number of subjects investigated, but it could also 
reflect the increase in clearance from the low ERH range. Yet, it appears that it is probably 
easier to differentiate high vs low ERH drugs based on inhibition drug-drug interaction or 
decreased pharmacogenomic activity studies than for induction or increased 
pharmacogenomic activity studies.
Rogge et al. [ 11] reported the effect of enoxacin inhibition on the metabolism of the low 
ERH drug theophylline following 200 mg single oral doses. Following 9 enoxacin 25 mg 
doses every 12 hr, a single 200 mg oral dose of theophylline (as Theo-Dur®) was compared Benet et al. Page 8
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptwith a 200 mg oral dose of theophylline prior to enoxacin administration resulting in the 
following ratios: AUC inhibition /AUC control  = 1.42; t½inhibition /t½control  = 1.35; 
Cmax,inhibition /Cmax,control  = 1.30, values that are similar to one another and consistent with 
what would be expected for a low ERH drug.
Midazolam is a CYP3A substrate with an intermediate ERH (plasma clearance hepatic = 46 
L/hr) and an FG = 0.57 [ 12]. Concomitant dosing of 100 mg fluconazole with single oral 3 
mg doses of midazolam yielded AUC inhibition /AUC control  = 2.16; t½inhibition /t½control  = 1.25; 
Cmax,inhibition /Cmax,control  = 1.77 [ 12]. These data illustrate the point discussed above that for 
CYP3A substrates the effect of inhibition on FG yields single dose C max changes closer in 
magnitude to AUC  changes than might be expected as given in Tables 1 and 2. Backman et 
al. [13] investigated the inhibition and induction of midazolam, with concomitant multiple 
oral doses of itraconazole and rifampin, respectively, in 9 healthy volunteers noting that 
plasma concentration-time curves for oral midazolam may differ by 400-fold between the 
two interactions, as shown in Table 4. Here again, single dose Cmax ratios for this CYP3A 
substrate are much closer to AUC  changes, than t½ changes.
Finally, Fig. 3 depicts the oral and IV propranolol blood concentration-time curves in 9 
normal subjects and 7 patients with cirrhosis observed during the seventh dosing interval for 
an oral 8 hr dosing regimen measuring unlabeled drug with a simultaneous tritiated IV dose 
of propranolol as reported by Wood et al. [ 14]. For this intermediate-high ERH drug, the 
change in AUC  and half-life following IV dosing in the cirrhosis patients is not as great as 
following oral doses, since the AUC IV Eq. 8 [ 1] is a function of both QH and CLint, with the 
QH term markedly damping the effect of decreased CLint in the cirrhosis patients.
AUC IV=DIV⋅QH+fu,B⋅CLint
QH⋅fu,B⋅CLint(8)
However, following oral doses, Eq. 4 is the relevant relationship and the change of CLint in 
the cirrhosis patients has a marked effect on AUC, C max and t½ . As noted in Fig. 3 for the 
oral multiple doses, the data appear to follow a one-compartment body model with first 
order absorption as previously seen in the upper panels of Fig. 1.
Conclusions
Following multiple dosing to steady-state, oral systemic concentration time curves appear to 
follow a one-compartment body model, but with the rate limiting half-life smaller, and often 
significantly smaller, than the single dose terminal half-life. This simplified disposition 
model at steady-state, as well as after single dose studies, allows comparisons of measurable 
parameters, AUC, C max, t½ and t max, to be utilized following drug interaction or PG 
variance studies to characterize whether a drug is low versus high hepatic extraction ratio, 
even without IV dosing. We believe that such drug interaction and pharmacogenomic 
variance studies are the only means to characterize the relative magnitude of the extraction 
ratio for a drug in humans exclusively studied following oral doses. The characteristics of 
drugs based on ratios of AUC, C max and t½  are identified with the recognition that volume 
of distribution is essentially unchanged for these drug interaction and PG variance studies Benet et al. Page 9
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptwhere only metabolic outcomes are changed and transporters are not significantly involved. 
Comparisons of Cmax changes following single dose interaction and PG variance studies 
may also identify the significance of FG changes. Pharmacodynamic changes would be 
expected to directionally follow pharmacokinetic changes for these metabolic drug 
interaction and pharmacogenomic variance studies, but not necessarily to the same extent. 
Once the relative magnitude of ERH is determined, both drug development scientists and 
clinicians will recognize that for high ERH drugs changes in exposure may be significantly 
more than estimated based on clearance and half-life changes.

A. Log concentration-time plots for an orally dosed drug (100mg) following two 
compartment disposition kinetics where volume of the central compartment ( V1) is 100 L, 
the rate constant of elimination from the central compartment ( k10) is 0.1 hr−1, the 
distribution rate constants into and out of the peripheral compartment ( k12 and k21) are 0.06 
hr−1and 0.08 hr−1, respectively (resulting in two-compartment exponential functions of λ1 = 
0.2 hr−1 and λ2 = 0.04 hr−1), an hepatic clearance of 10 L/hr, a first order absorption rate 
constant ( ka) of 1.0 hr−1and a bioavailability ( F ) of 0.8 where the upper curve represents 
steady state dosing every 12 hr and the lower curve depicts a single oral dose. The terminal 
half-life from the lower curve is 17.3 hr, while t½,op for the multiple dosing upper curve is 
8.8 hr.Benet et al. Page 12

dose, FA·FG , distribution, elimination and absorption rate constants are unchanged from that 
in Fig. 1A but hepatic clearance is increased to 70 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.2. V1 
is increased to 700L so that the terminal half-life for the single oral dose remains at 17.3 hr, 
while t½,op from the multiple dosing upper curve is 7.8 hr.
C. The single dose and multiple dose time curves for the low ERH drug depicted in Fig. 1A 
when clearance is decreased by 50% to 5 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.85. From the 
upper steady state curve, t½,op = 17.2 hr; from the lower single dose curve the terminal half-
life is 28.9 hr.
D. The single dose and multiple dose time curves for the high ERH drug depicted in Fig. 1B 
when clearance is decreased by 50% to 35 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.55. From the 
upper steady state curve, t½,op = 17.2 hr; from the lower single dose curve the terminal half-
life is 28.9 hr.
E. The single dose and multiple dose time curves for the low ERH drug depicted in Fig. 1A 
when clearance is doubled to 20 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.70. From the upper 
steady state curve, t½,op = 4.7 hr; from the lower single dose curve the terminal half-life is 
12.4 hr.
F. The single dose and multiple dose time curves for the high ERH drug depicted in Fig. 1B 
when clearance is increased by 10L/hr to 80 L/hr, which results in F becoming 0.1. From the
