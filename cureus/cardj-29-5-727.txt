Opioids and oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors:  
A drug–drug interaction

As recommended in the European 
Society of Cardiology guidelines, titrated  
intravenous opioids should be consid-
ered to relieve pain in patients present-
ing with ST-segment elevation myocar-
dial infarction (STEMI) (class of recom-
mendation IIa, level of evidence C) [1].  
The class of recommendation for mor-
phine use in STEMI has been lowered 
from I to IIa (i.e., from “it is indicated” 
to “should be considered”) as com-pared to previous guidelines, due to the 
unfavorable impact of morphine on P2Y12 recep-
tor inhibitors bioavailability and their antiplatelet 
effect [2–4]. 
The CRUSADE registry was the first to sug-
gest drug–drug interaction between morphine and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, as it reported an 
increased prevalence of adverse clinical outcome 
in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients receiv-
ing morphine and clopidogrel [5]. This sugges -
tion was then proven in a randomized, placebo-
controlled trial in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) [2] and was confirmed in several other studies [3, 4, 6–8]. According to ticagrelor 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, 
compared with healthy volunteers, patients with 
uncomplicated AMI appear to have similar plasma 
concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabo-lite — AR-C124910XX after loading dose adminis-
tration. Co-administration of morphine results in 
a decrease in ticagrelor bioavailability to a degree similar in both groups. However, while platelet 
inhibition in healthy volunteers is largely inde-pendent of morphine, in AMI patients 
the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor is 
significantly less pronounced with co-
administration of morphine [4, 9]. The 
greater susceptibility to the P2Y12 
receptor inhibitor-morphine interac -
tion seen in AMI patients is probably due to enhanced platelet activation in this subset of patients. In a meta-
analysis by Gue et al. [10], patients 
pretreated with morphine were shown to have a higher rate of reinfarction 
than those not receiving morphine. Several ap-proaches to overcome the “morphine effect” in 
patients with ACS have been proposed, showing 
some, but unsatisfactory effects [11–16]. Iglesias  
et al. [17] reported results of the PERSEUS study —  
a randomized trial comparing the impact of fentanyl versus morphine on ticagrelor pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics in STEMI patients under-
going primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Previously, reduced bioavailability of ticagre-
lor had been demonstrated when co-administered 
with fentanyl in stable patients [17], however the influence of fentanyl on ticagrelor absorption and 
platelet inhibition in AMI patients had not been 
established. The PERSEUS study was prematurely 
terminated after the inclusion of 68% of originally 
designed study population due to a slower than anticipated patient enrolment rate resulting in 
loss of statistical power. Nevertheless, the study brought consistent pharmacodynamic and pharma-cokinetic evidence that fentanyl may be associated 
with a more favourable ticagrelor absorption profile 
727
www.cardiologyjournal.orgthan morphine, while exerting a similar analgesic 
effect. Indeed, these results do provide a strong 
premise supporting the preferential use of fentanyl 
over morphine in symptomatic STEMI patients 
undergoing primary PCI. The PERSEUS study, 
however, does not provide a comparison with any non-opioid treatment strategy, making it impossible 
to truly assess the effects of fentanyl on the phar-
macokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor in AMI patients. In this specific clinical setting, 
despite opioid-induced decreased bioavailability of 
P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, some additional factors, 
including enhanced platelet activation and reduced 
gastrointestinal perfusion as well as impact of mild therapeutic hypothermia applied in cardiac arrest 
survivors, may also impede the effect of oral anti-
platelet drugs [18–24].
Further research enriches the knowledge on 
the possibility of reducing the clinical significance 
of the opioid-P2Y12 receptor inhibitor interactions, 
however, without bringing any breakthroughs to date. Therefore, for the time being, ensuring im-
mediate inhibition of platelets by using the bridging 
therapy with cangrelor, seems to be the best solu-tion of all [25, 26]. Nevertheless, the limited avail-
ability of this intravenous P2Y12 receptor inhibitor 
is a serious obstacle to widespread implementation 
of this approach.
