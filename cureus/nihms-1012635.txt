Abstract
Some form of dietary supplement is taken by over 70% of Americans every day and the 
supplement industry is currently big business with a gross of over $28 billion. However, unlike 
either foods or drugs, supplements do not need to be registered or approved by the FDA prior to 
production or sales. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), 
FDA is restricted to adverse report monitoring post-marketing. Despite widespread consumption, 
there is limited evidence of health benefits related to nutraceutical or supplement use in well-
nourished adults. In contrast, a small number of these products have the potential to produce 
significant toxicity. In addition, it is rare that patients disclose supplement use to their physicians. 
Therefore, the risk of adverse drug-supplement interactions is significant. An overview of the 
major supplement and nutraceutical classes is presented here together with known toxic effects 
and potential for drug interactions.

INTRODUCTION
Dietary supplements are products that are ingested in addition to the regular diet in order to 
provide additional health-promoting nutrients. In the US, dietary supplements are defined 
and regulated according to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 
1994 ( 1). According to the DSHEA, a dietary supplement is a product that is intended to 
supplement the diet, contains dietary ingredients including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, 
herbs and botanicals, is intended to be ingested as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid, and is 
labeled as being a dietary supplement ( 1,2). Food items that are fortified with nutrients such 
as vitamins and minerals to ensure proper nutrient levels are not considered dietary

understood to be a purified product derived from a human food source, which is purported to 
provide extra health benefits beyond the basic nutritional value found in foods.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements in a markedly 
different way than regular drugs. A manufacturer of a drug needs to document its 
effectiveness and safety before it can be brought to the market. There is no requirement for 
demonstrating the efficacy of a dietary supplement for any health condition. Manufacturers 
of dietary supplements are not allowed to claim that the supplement can be used for treating 
or preventing any particular disease. However, statements pertaining to general well-being, 
function and health can be allowed provided a disclaimer is listed on the product with the 
text: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to 
diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease” ( 2). The requirements for safety of dietary 
supplements are much less stringent than for a drug. No clinical trials are required. 
Ingredients sold in the US before October 15, 1994 do not need safety evaluation by the 
FDA, as they are generally recognized as safe based on their historical use. For a new dietary 
ingredient not sold before October 15, 1994, the manufacturer must notify the FDA and 
provide reasonable evidence that it is safe for human consumption ( 2).
Dietary supplements are widely used. Half of adults in the US report having used at least 
one supplement in the past 30 days ( 3). The most cited reasons for taking the supplements 
were to improve overall health, maintain health, and, especially among women, for bone 
health. The most commonly used supplements were multivitamin/mineral supplements, 
calcium supplements, and omega-3/fish oil ( 3). About a quarter of the supplements were 
used based on advice by health care providers. Thus, most decisions to use supplements are 
made by the consumers themselves.
Despite their popularity, the health benefits of dietary supplements are questionable. Lack of 
vitamins will certainly cause deficiency diseases such as scurvy, beriberi, pellagra, and 
rickets. However, the vitamin content of normal well-balanced diets is sufficient to avoid 
these diseases. Studies aimed at determining effects of supplements often give conflicting 
results. There currently doesn’t seem to be any scientific consensus on whether vitamins ( 4) 
or any other dietary supplements prevent disease or have health benefits in well-nourished 
individuals.
The intake of dietary supplements is generally safe, but not totally without risk. The current 
review is not intended to be comprehensive report of all known adverse effect for all dietary 
supplements. Instead, we have selected to discuss adverse events for the most commonly 
used supplements such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3/fish oil, soy protein, and plant-
derived antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals. We also discuss weight-loss and 
body building supplements, and various botanical supplements which have been associated 
with more severe adverse effects.
Since dietary supplements can be brought to the market without the support of clinical trials, 
there is a paucity of systematic studies of adverse effects. Case reports of symptoms 
appearing after intake of a supplement often provide the first hint that there can be side Ronis et al. Page 2
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscripteffects associated with the supplement. However, it is close to impossible to show causation 
from a single case report. The link can be strengthened if symptoms disappear with cessation 
of intake and reappear if the supplement is ingested again. Otherwise, an accumulation of 
cases over time or the appearance of a cluster of cases can ultimately establish that intake of 
a supplement can result in adverse effects.
VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS
By the early 20th century, it had become clear that nutrition consisting solely of 
carbohydrates, fats, and proteins is insufficient for maintaining health. The term “vitamine” 
was coined by Casimir Funk in 1912 to describe the micronutrients whose deficiencies cause 
beriberi, scurvy, and pellagra ( 5). As the various vitamins were isolated and synthesized, a 
market for vitamins quickly developed. Today, multivitamin/multimineral, vitamin and 
mineral supplements are the most widely utilized dietary supplements by the American 
population ( 3,6). It has been reported that 33% of US adults use multivitamin and/or 
multimineral supplements ( 7) and that this is as high as 32–47% among male military 
personnel and 40–63% among military women ( 8). Among long term cancer survivors, use 
of vitamin or mineral supplements is even higher at 64–81% ( 7). Although adequate intake 
of these micronutrients is required to maintain optimal health, the possibility of toxicity 
increases with increasing dose ( 9). Since dietary micronutrient deficiency is increasingly 
rare in developed counties, most supplement consumers actually have excess vitamin and 
mineral intake. Despite widespread belief that vitamin and mineral supplements are health 
beneficial, recent reviews of vitamin and mineral supplement trials in community-dwelling 
adults with no nutritional deficiencies have concluded that there is no clear evidence of 
beneficial health effects. These include primary or secondary prevention of chronic diseases 
including cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline and effects on overall mortality 
(10,11). Indeed, on the contrary, there is evidence for possible harm based on consumption 
of individual vitamins and mineral in excess. Toxicity following consumption of water-
soluble vitamins is rare. However, photosensitivity and neurotoxicity have been reported at 
doses higher than 500 mg/d of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) ( 12) and cases of pyridoxine-
associated chronic sensory polyneuropathy have been reported in elderly patients consuming 
multivitamin supplements ( 13). Reports of toxicity associated with overconsumption of 
supplemental antioxidant fat-soluble vitamins are more prevalent. Vitamin E is a family of 8 
related tocopherols and tocotrienols of which α-tocopherol is the form generally used in 
supplements. Doses of 800–1200 mg/d can result in bleeding associated with antiplatelet 
action and doses above 1200 mg/d can result in diarrhea, weakness, blurred vision and 
gonadal dysfunction ( 12). Moreover, vitamin E supplementation following radiation therapy 
in a randomized trial of head and neck cancer patients was associated with increased cancer 
recurrence in the first 3.5 years of follow-up ( 14) and meta-analysis has suggested an 
increase in all-cause mortality after high dose vitamin E supplementation ( 15). Toxicity has 
also been associated with consumption of supplemental vitamin A and its provitamin 
carotenoid precursors. In two large clinical trials, the Retinol Efficacy Trial ( 16) and the 
ATBC study ( 17), male smokers receiving β-carotene supplements had significantly 
increased risk of lung cancer. The ABTC study further showed that prostate cancer incidence 
and mortality were increased in male alcohol users consuming the supplement. An Ronis et al. Page 3
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptadditional two studies have suggested increased mortality in smokers consuming β-carotene 
supplements ( 18,19). Excess vitamin A supplementation has been suggested to be associated 
with adverse effects on bone health including low bone mineral density and increased 
fracture risk ( 20). In addition, women consuming large amounts of vitamin A supplements 
during pregnancy have been reported to have increased incidence of congenital 
abnormalities ( 21). There is also a case report of intra-hepatic cholestasis in a patient with 
chronic hypervitaminosis A after 12 years of supplement consumption which resolved after 
supplements were ceased ( 22). In addition to toxicity from excess vitamin consumption, 
toxicity can arise from excess consumption of minerals. In particular, there is an increasing 
risk of hyperchromatosis, an iron storage disease associated with liver injury after excess 
consumption of iron or multimineral supplements ( 23,24). This can be exacerbated by 
alcohol consumption ( 24).
FISH OIL AND OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS
Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized de novo  in humans 
and therefore must be provided through the diet ( 25). A link between fish oil and ischemic 
heart disease was suggested by a widely-publicized study from 1971 of Eskimos 
(Greenlanders) from the west coast of Greenland ( 26). Greenlanders eating a traditional 
meat and fish diet that is rich in polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids had significantly lower 
levels of plasma total lipids, plasma cholesterol, plasma triglycerides and pre- β-lipoprotein 
(= very low density lipoprotein) than both Danes and Greenlanders living in Denmark. The 
authors hypothesized that this diet contributed to the low incidence of ischemic heart disease 
and diabetes among Greenlanders. Since then, polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids taken in 
the form of fish oils, krill oil or mixtures of docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids 
(DHA and EPA) purified from fish oils have become widely utilized dietary supplements. 
These fatty acids have metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties and have electrical 
stabilizing effects on ion channels in cardiac myocytes ( 27,28). They have been linked to 
anti-cancer and cardioprotective effects ( 29,30). However, the therapeutic benefits on 
cardiovascular diseases are still controversial due to disparate findings from different clinical 
trials ( 31).
It appears that fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids are well tolerated even at doses of 1–2,000 
mg/d and there is little evidence of toxicity. However, simultaneous consumption of fish 
liver oils which also contain vitamin A and multivitamin supplements could result in 
hypervitaminosis A. Furthermore, fish oils and omega-3 fatty acid supplements may 
exacerbate anticoagulation and promote bleeding in patients taking anticoagulant 
medications such as warfarin ( 32,33).
PROTEIN POWDERS AND INFANT FORMULA
Protein powders consisting of the dairy proteins casein, whey and of vegetable proteins in 
soy protein isolate (SPI) are popular supplements among athletes and body builders. These 
proteins are also the basis of infant formulas fed to over 4 million U.S. infants each year. 
The dairy proteins appear to have little toxicity except in individuals with allergies to cow’s 
milk protein, although excessive consumption may result in ketosis. In contrast, there is an Ronis et al. Page 4
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptongoing debate with regard to the potential safety of SPI. This is related primarily to the 
presence of weakly estrogenic compounds – the isoflavones genistein and daidzein which 
are among the 100 phytochemicals which remain bound to the protein isolate ( 34). These 
compounds can reach potentially estrogenic levels after SPI consumption in soy-formula fed 
infants and in children, men and post-menopausal women taking soy protein supplements. 
Concerns have focused on potential estrogenic effects in early development resulting in 
reproductive toxicity, infertility, demasculinization and increased promotion of estrogen-
responsive cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer ( 35–37). Several clinical studies of 
SPI and soy formula toxicity have been conducted. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation 
analysis of vaginal cells from cow- and soy-infant formula fed girls indicated differential 
DNA methylation associated with decreased expression of the estrogen-responsive proline 
rich 5-like (PRR5L) gene ( 38). In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested a slightly 
earlier age of menarche (12.4 vs. 12.8 years) but less female-typical play in soy formula-fed 
girls ( 39,40). In contrast, data from a longitudinal ultrasound study of breast, cow’s milk 
formula and soy-formula-fed infants (The Beginnings Study) demonstrated no significant 
effects on testis or prostate volumes or structural characteristics at ages 1 year and 5 years 
(41,42). In addition, a retrospective cross-sectional study of adults fed soy formula or cow-
milk formula as infants did not find significant differences in responses to questions about 
health and reproduction ( 43). Moreover, in adult men, a recent meta-analysis showed no 
significant effects of soy protein on male reproductive hormones ( 44). Animal studies of SPI 
and soy formula toxicity have likewise been contradictory. Akingbemi et al. ( 45) reported 
that perinatal exposure to diets made with soy resulted in suppressed steroidogenesis, 
decreased testosterone secretion and increased Leydig cell proliferation in rats. Similarly, 
Sharpe et al. ( 46,47) reported that marmoset monkeys fed soy infant formula had suppressed 
serum testosterone concentrations. Increased testis size, and Leydig cell numbers/testis were 
also observed in these monkeys at adulthood consistent with compensated Leydig cell 
failure. In adult female ovariectomized mice, feeding SPI was shown to increase growth of 
human breast cancer cell xenografts consistent with an estrogenic effect ( 48). These studies, 
and concerns regarding estrogenicity, led to a recent review of the safety of soy infant 
formula by a panel from the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction 
(CERHR) established by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and the National Institute 
for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). However, the committee was unable to issue a 
conclusive recommendation regarding developmental and reproductive toxicity as a result of 
limitations in the available human data ( 49). In contrast to the small number of animal 
studies with SPI suggesting estrogenicity, lifetime feeding studies in rats fed with soy 
protein isolate (SPI), the sole protein source in soy formulas revealed no effects on sex organ 
weights, no effects on serum sex steroids concentrations and no effects on fertility ( 36). 
Moreover, chronic feeding studies with SPI in adult male cynomolgus macaque monkeys 
also are reported to have had no effect on testis weight, morphology, serum testosterone or 
estradiol concentrations, or sperm counts ( 50). In addition, our laboratory has conducted a 
series of studies in ovariectomized adult female rats, in prepubertal male and female rats and 
in neonatal piglets in which we have utilized genomics analysis either with Affymetrix chips 
or using RNAseq to examine head to head gene expression profiles in the liver, bone, 
mammary gland, uterus and testis after treatment with 17 β-estradiol (E2) or feeding SPI 
(51–56). These studies revealed only minor overlap between E2 and SPI-regulated genes (3–Ronis et al. Page 5
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript10%) representing specific subsets of E2 regulated pathways, indicative of actions similar to 
those of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), rather than weak estrogens, and 
with either no effect or antagonist actions on reproductive and proliferative pathways.
NUTRACEUTICALS
Most commonly used nutraceuticals are compounds derived from fruits and vegetables. 
They are often compounds with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties which are 
suggested to provide protection against chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis ( 57). Widely consumed nutraceuticals include flavonoid 
plant pigments such as anthocyanins from berries, flavonols from dark chocolate, 
polyphenols such as resveratrol from red grapes, and catechins from tea and quercetin. There 
is little data to suggest that these compounds are toxic. However, metabolites of EGCG – the 
active catechol in green tea extract, typically considered to be responsible for green tea’s 
antioxidant properties – are suspected to enhance oxidative stress and have been associated 
with liver injury ( 58). It is also far from clear that consumption of these nutraceutical 
supplements have true health benefits given a lack of large clinical trials ( 57). The most 
intensively studied nutraceutical flavonoids are the soy derived isoflavones genistein and 
daidzein, and the daidzein metabolite equol. Unlike other flavonoids, the isoflavones in their 
purified form have been shown to possess estrogenic properties in vitro and in animal 
models, including the ability to produce uterine hypertrophy or reproductive tract 
malformations, reduce testis size, inhibit androgen production, reduce fertility, and stimulate 
estrogen-dependent tumor growth ( 36,37,45,48,49,51,52,56). Since evidence emerged 
demonstrating health risks following hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal 
women, menopausal women have increasingly turned to use of dietary supplements to treat 
symptoms such as hot flashes, depression and bone loss. A recent survey indicated that as 
many as 42% of such women were using soy products including isoflavone extracts and 
purified isoflavones such as genistein ( 58). Since these are concentrated or purified products, 
they can achieve far higher plasma levels than when isoflavones are consumed as part of SPI 
or soy foods, which are complex mixtures of bioactive proteins, peptides and over one 
hundred phytochemicals ( 34,36,51). There have been case reports of endometriosis in 
women consuming isoflavone supplements ( 59) and, given the clear evidence of 
estrogenicity, there is a likelihood of increased risk of estrogen sensitive cancers in 
consumers of these products.
WEIGHT-LOSS, SPORTS, AND BODYBUILDING SUPPLEMENTS
As more and more of the world population becomes overweight and obese, there is a huge 
market for weight-loss products, including dietary supplements. Among military service 
members, athletes and bodybuilders it is also common to ingest dietary sports supplements 
intended to burn fat and increase performance, muscle mass or strength. As examples, 53% 
of active-duty US Army soldiers report using at least one dietary supplement per week ( 60), 
and 64% of college students participating in athletics use dietary supplements to enhance 
performance ( 61). The supplements are often proprietary blends of several supposedly 
natural ingredients. They are not without risk of adverse effects. In a recent review, it is 
estimated that the proportion of drug-induced liver injuries that are due to dietary Ronis et al. Page 6
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptsupplements is currently around 20%. Furthermore, bodybuilding and weight loss 
supplements account for almost half of these injuries ( 62). Among emergency department 
visits for adverse events related to dietary supplements in the US, around 25% were due to 
weight loss products ( 63). There are two classes of adverse effects that may occur. 
Supplements can have components according to the product description that cause certain 
side effects. Supplements may also be intentionally spiked with unlisted or illegal 
compounds, or drugs such as anabolic steroids. These are so-called adulterated supplements. 
Supplements containing declared compounds that have not been adequately tested for safety 
can also be declared adulterated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has 
been argued that adulterated supplements shouldn’t be considered real dietary supplements 
(64). Yet, such supplements exist and can readily be obtained e.g. over the internet. 
Furthermore, they may be more likely to give real physiological effects desired by the 
consumer due to the pharmacological efficiency of anabolic steroids or other drugs 
incorporated in the supplements. Medical providers and toxicologists should be therefore be 
aware of symptoms elicited by these compounds.
Body weight supplements with some documented weight-loss effects were those containing 
extracts of the plant Ephedra , also known as Ma Huang. Extracts contain the 
sympathomimetic alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, and 
norephedrine. Some of these alkaloids are currently incorporated in common pharmaceutical 
medications. For example, pseudoephedrine is included as a nasal decongestant in several 
brands of cold and allergy medication in the US like Claritin-D and Sudafed. A 
comprehensive meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that ephedra or ephedrine-containing 
products overall led to modest short-term weight loss of approximately 0.9 kg/month better 
than placebo ( 65). There were significant 2.2–3.6 fold increased risks of adverse effects in 
the form of psychiatric symptoms, autonomic hyperactivity, heart palpitations, and upper 
gastrointestinal symptoms ( 65). Autonomic hyperactivity including symptoms such as 
tremors, jitteriness, insomnia and increased perspiration was very common, affecting more 
than 20% of subjects taking ephedrine. However, caffeine may have contributed to some of 
the side effects, as caffeine was included in most of the ephedrine-containing products. A 
review of 140 adverse events reports submitted to the FDA between June 1, 1997 and March 
31, 1999 resulted in 31% of cases considered to the definitely or probably related to the 
intake of dietary supplements with ephedra alkaloids ( 66). The most common event was 
hypertension, but they also included cases of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
cardiac arrest with 3 deaths and 7 permanent disabilities. It led the authors to conclude that, 
“dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids pose a serious health risks to some 
users”. More than a dozen cases of liver injury have also been reported after intake of 
ephedra preparations ( 67). Dietary supplements with ephedra were banned by the FDA in 
2004 ( 68).
One of the compounds that has until recently been widely incorporated in sports 
supplements is 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA). It was used in roughly 200 supplements 
with more than $100 million in sales in 2010 ( 69). DMAA is a pharmaceutical developed 
and patented by Eli Lilly & Co. as a nasal inhaler for rhinitis with “the desirable properties 
of both ephedrine and amphetamine” ( 70). It has sympathomimetic and vasoconstrictive 
properties. Producers of dietary supplements have listed the compound as a natural Ronis et al. Page 7
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcomponent of Geranium plants, e.g. as geranium extract ( 71). However, the presence of 
DMAA in plants has not been verified, leading to the conclusion that DMAA in supplements 
is generated by chemical synthesis ( 72). DMAA has further been banned as a performance 
enhancing drug by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( 73). One version of the weight-loss 
supplement OxyELITE Pro from USPlabs, LLC contained the compound 1,3-
dimethylamylamine (DMAA) in addition to ingredients such as caffeine, Bauhinia purpurea , 
Bacopa monniera , Cirsium oligophyllum , and rauwolscine (Yohimbe) extract. Studies that 
were supported financially by USPlabs, LLC with a small number of healthy volunteers 
suggested that this supplement formulation could increase lipolysis, metabolic rate, heart 
rate and systolic blood pressure in the short term (2 h) as well as lead to small decreases in 
appetite, body weight, and BMI after intake for 8 weeks ( 74). Accidental intake of 
supplements with DMAA, mainly in children, have caused relatively mild adverse effects 
such as tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting ( 75). However, serious cardiovascular events after 
DMAA intake have also been reported. Recreational use of DMAA in New Zealand has 
been associated with cases of cerebral hemorrhage ( 76,77). Furthermore, there are three 
cases of cardiac arrest occurring during physical exercise in the military and in a gym 
following intake of DMAA-containing supplements ( 71,78). Two of the events eventually 
led to the deaths of US soldiers. While it cannot be proven that DMAA is the causative agent 
for all the adverse events, it is clear that DMAA does indeed have cardiovascular effects 
such as vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure ( 79,80). Following receipt of 42 
adverse events reports on products with DMAA, the FDA in April 2012 sent warning letters 
to 10 manufacturers of DMAA-containing supplements stating that since the safety of 
DMAA had not been documented, the products were adulterated, according to US law ( 81).
In 2013, a series of severe hepatic liver disease was observed in individuals from Hawaii 
awaiitaking the weight-loss supplement OxyELITE Pro from USPlabs, LLC ( 82,83). Eight 
previously healthy individuals presented with symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, abdominal 
pain and jaundice. Levels of alanine transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated. Of three 
patients developing fulminant hepatic failure, two required a liver transplant and one died. A 
subsequent outbreak investigation conducted by the Hawaii Department of Health in 
collaboration with the CDC and FDA identified a total of 36 cases of acute hepatitis in 
individuals exposed to OxyELITE Pro ( 84). All had dark urine and most had jaundice, loss 
of appetite and fatigue. Around 2013, additional cases of acute liver injury in patients that 
had taken OxyELITE Pro were observed in the US in the Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
Network (DILIN) prospective study and among military personnel in Southern California 
(85,86). From January 2011 to February 2014, the FDA received adverse event reports for 
114 consumers that had used OxyELITE Pro. 55 cases (48%) were classified as having liver 
disease likely due to OxyELITE Pro ( 87). The incidence of liver disease seemed to spike 
after February 2013. Tallying cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology occurring from 
April 1, 2013 to December 5, 2013 in individuals who consumed OxyELITE Pro in the 60 
days prior to illness resulted in 69 case patients, of whom 32 were hospitalized, 3 received 
liver transplants and one died ( 88). The spike in liver disease coincided with a reformulation 
of OxyELITE Pro to DMAA-free versions of OxyELITE Pro (“New Formula” and “Super 
Thermo”) that, instead of DMAA, contained the compound aegeline ( 83). Aegeline is an 
alkaloidal-amide occurring naturally in the bael tree ( Aegle marmelos ) with Ronis et al. Page 8
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptantihyperglycemic effects in a diabetic rat model ( 89). However, there do not appear to be 
relevant studies on the effects of aegeline in humans. In a warning letter to USPlabs, the 
FDA wrote that aegeline should be classified as a “new dietary ingredient” since it was not 
marketed in the US before October 15, 1994. As the company further had failed “to provide 
reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk 
of illness or injury”, the FDA deemed the aegeline-containing supplements to be adulterated 
(90). The aegeline-containing supplements were subsequently recalled ( 91).
It is unclear if the aegeline in OxyELITE Pro was the hepatotoxic agent causing the outbreak 
of liver disease. While feeding rats Aegle marmelos  plant material has resulted in liver 
lesions in the form of centrilobular congestion and hydropic degeneration ( 92), it is 
unknown whether this was due to aegeline or other compounds. The aegeline in OxyELITE 
Pro may further have been a synthetic compound of unknown purity ( 93). As no other 
known hepatotoxic agents was found in OxyELITE Pro, the specific causative agent remains 
unidentified ( 88). The link between the observed cases of hepatitis and OxyELITE intake 
has also been questioned. Teschke and Eickhoff argue that clinicians describing the first 
cases were not sufficiently fastidious in excluding other causes of liver disease such as 
acetaminophen toxicity, liver cirrhosis, and viral hepatitis, and that causality scores on the 
Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) were inflated to show that 
OxyELITE Pro was the probable cause for the cases ( 94).
It is remarkable that OxyELITE Pro products have been adulterated with two different 
compounds, DMAA and aegeline. There is even a recent notification from the FDA that a 
batch of OxyELITE Pro Super Thermogenic was found to contain fluoxetine, also known as 
Prozac ( 95). While USPlabs, LLC has claimed that this latter batch represented a counterfeit 
product not manufactured by the company, it certainly underscores that segments of the 
dietary supplement business employ shady or even criminal manufacturing and business 
practices that result in consumers being exposed to untested or undeclared compounds.
OxyELITE Pro is not the only multi-ingredient dietary supplement associated with liver 
injury. The LiverTox database lists incidences of hepatotoxicity attributed to the brands 
Slimquick, Herbalife, Hydroxycut and Move Free ( 67). Earlier versions of Hydroxycut 
contained ephedra, but otherwise the exact mechanisms of injury are generally unknown, 
even though some of the cases may be due to the content of green tea, Aloe vera , and 
Chinese skullcap.
The examples listed above represent adverse effects caused by ingredients listed by the 
producers. More insidious is the addition of unlisted ingredients or drugs to dietary 
supplements. Anti-obesity drugs rimonabant, orlistat, and sibutramine or analogues thereof 
have been found in weight-loss supplements from Germany, Turkey, China, and Poland ( 96). 
Side effects of these drugs, like panic attacks, psychotic episodes, and increases in blood 
pressure and heart rate in the case of sibutramine may therefore also be encountered in 
individuals using such adulterated supplements.
Body-building supplements are quite often adulterated with anabolic steroids that are 
modified variants of androgens designed to increase muscle mass. Studies from 2001 and Ronis et al. Page 9
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2002 based on nutritional supplements purchased in 13 countries, including the US, 
indicated that around 15% of nutritional supplements contained non-declared anabolic 
androgenic steroids ( 97). Adverse effects of anabolic steroids include cardiomyopathy, 
altered serum lipids, acne, swollen breast tissues in men and hepatotoxicity ( 98). Several 
patients have developed hepatic cholestasis after intake of anabolic androgens ( 99,100). In 
the US, the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to identify 
and characterize cases of hepatotoxicity caused by dietary supplements and drugs, with the 
exception of acetaminophen. Among 847 cases whose liver injuries were confirmed to be 
caused by drugs or supplements, 45 (5.3%) were due to use of bodybuilding supplements 
(101). This latter group was characterized by consisting exclusively of males that all had 
jaundice and where most (84%) had pruritus. The pattern of liver injury resembled that of 
bland cholestasis. Compared to other cases, the levels of serum ALT, AST and ALP were 
lower, but the levels of total bilirubin were higher, and they were jaundiced for longer 
periods of time ( 101). The mechanism whereby the anabolic steroids induce hepatotoxicity 
is poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized to be mediated by activation of the 
androgen receptor in hepatic cells, leading to upregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme, 
CPT1, in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, increased oxidative stress, and ultimately 
mitochondrial degeneration and hepatotoxicity ( 98).
BOTANICAL SUPPLEMENTS
Traditional herbal medicine can be said to be the precursor for both drugs used in modern 
medicine that are based on plant compounds (such as aspirin and morphine) and for 
contemporary botanical dietary supplements. Herbal and botanical products have sustained 
popularity given the fact that these natural (i.e. derived from plant root, leaves, or bark) 
substances were among the oldest therapeutics. Estimates published by the CDC as part of 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2006 reported that 20% of 
adults use a supplement containing at least one botanical ingredient ( 102). A common 
motivation for taking these substances is to “improve overall health” ( 3). Accordingly, the 
US Food and Drug Administration regulates the majority of botanicals as dietary 
supplements and not as drugs developed for the treatment or prevention of specific maladies 
(103). Botanical use is correlated with non-smoking and higher self-reported health ( 3). 
Alarmingly, patients frequently do not report herbal supplement use to primary care 
physicians ( 104), a concern because many botanical supplements may interact with 
prescribed medications. On their own, bioactive constituents of botanicals can have acute 
adverse effects that require hospitalization. This review describes acute adverse effects and 
herb-drug interactions of the most common botanical and herbal supplements.
Because of their plant-based derivation, botanical supplements consist of a mixture of 
organic compounds. Only a fraction of these compounds is biologically active, with a small 
subset of the active compounds having therapeutic and/or toxic mechanisms of action. Table 
1 presents a list of commonly used and researched botanical supplements, their primary 
active constituents, typical use and dosage, and reported adverse effects.
Concurrent exposure to other compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals, smoking) and the 
heterogeneity of herbal supplements often obfuscates the determination of toxic mechanisms Ronis et al. Page 10
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptin clinical cases, even where doses of the supplement are reported. As such, reports of 
adverse effects directly attributable to botanicals are generally rare ( 105). In most such 
cases, effects are mild (e.g. nausea, fatigue, and headache). However, more serious clinical 
cases have appeared, most often relating to adverse effects falling under the general category 
of drug induced liver injury (DILI) and its associated mechanisms, namely mitochondrial 
dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alteration of bile acid homeostasis.
Black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa ) has been associated with jaundice and liver failure in 
menopausal women ( 106). Immunohistochemistry of biopsy samples revealed pathological 
oxidative stress. These results are consistent with in vivo  data showing increases in 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and decreased catalase activity with C. racemosa 
treatment in a rat menopausal model ( 107). Similarly, numerous case reports of kava kava 
detail liver toxicity sometimes requiring transplants (reviewed in ( 108)). Candidate 
mechanisms for kava kava liver toxicity include depletion of glutathione (increasing 
oxidative stress) and inhibition of cyclooxygenases (mitochondrial dysfunction) ( 109). Saw 
palmetto use has been associated with cholestatic hepatitis; subsequent alterations in bile 
secretion have been linked to pancreatitis ( 110). Cholestatic symptoms were also seen in 
patients with acute liver failure that had ingested Echinacea, although a specific mechanism 
has not been hypothesized ( 111). Valerian use induced jaundice that was reversed by steroid 
administration in a 57 year-old man ( 112). Case reports have presented a variety of other 
non-hepatic symptoms following botanical use. A bodybuilder taking yohimbe prior to a 
workout session suffered a seizure with tachycardia and hypertension, consistent with 
yohimbine’s sympathomimetic properties ( 113). A 68 year-old woman taking milk thistle 
presented with symptoms of exacerbated hemochromatosis (iron overload) that dissipated 
when she stopped taking the supplement. However, this patient was genetically predisposed 
to hemochromatosis and physicians withdrew excess iron via phlebotomy concomitant with 
her cessation of milk thistle use ( 114). Ginseng use was implicated in a transient ischemia 
attack in a 64 year-old man, though there was no evaluation as to the mechanism ( 115). In 
other cardiovascular outcomes, Black cohosh was deemed “probably responsible” for 
observed bradycardia in a 59 year-old woman. Slow heart rate is a reported side effect of 
black cohosh ( 116). The wide variety of compounds identified in black cohosh make it 
difficult to elucidate mechanisms, although the authors of the above case study speculated 
that black cohosh regulates heart rate via activation of serotonin receptors, consistent with 
experimental results ( 117). Both garlic and ginkgo biloba use have been involved in several 
cases of excessive bleeding. For example, a 71 year-old man had persistent surgical bleeding 
that was attributed to indulgent garlic ingestion prior to the operation ( 118). Furthermore, 
aged garlic extract inhibits platelet aggregation ( 119). Gingkolide B, an active component of 
gingko biloba, has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregating factor, and men and women 
taking ginkgo biloba have suffered spontaneous bleeding ( 120).
Compared to the above outcomes, more is known about potential herb-drug interactions. 
Pharmacologically active compounds in botanicals are, like drugs, substrates of 
metabolizing enzymes. As such, induction or suppression of relevant metabolizing enzymes 
can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs and may warrant contraindications by health care 
providers. In vitro studies have implicated activation of the pregnane-X receptor (PXR) and 
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a common mechanisms among several botanicals in Ronis et al. Page 11
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptinducing cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression ( 121–123). Clinical trials aim to identify such 
herb-drug pharmacokinetic interactions and their enzymatic targets via co-administration of 
an enzyme-specific probe. Investigated targets include the CYP enzymes, organic anion 
transporter (OAT) proteins, and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) ATP binding cassette transporter. 
Table 2 presents a representative list of several well-characterized herb-drug interactions 
from clinical studies of human volunteers.
CONCLUSIONS
The market for dietary supplements and nutraceuticals taken to improve the health or well-
being of the customer is enormous. However, they are not necessarily safe for everybody. 
Like regular drugs, supplements with active ingredients that provide a physiological or 
pharmacological effect are likely to also cause adverse effects in susceptible individuals. 
More attention to adverse effects and potential interactions is needed in order to avoid 
serious medical outcomes. Users and physicians alike should consult updated literature 
before beginning or advising a regimen involving these substances. Medical providers 
should be aware that a large fraction of general population take dietary supplements. They 
should therefore request information from patients about their supplement intake in order to 
provide optimal medical care.
