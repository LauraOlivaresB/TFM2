INTRODUCTION
The importance of drug–  drug interactions (DDI) in drug 
development and clinical practice is clear: DDIs may in-
crease the risk of treatment failures and the incidence and 
severity of adverse events. The successful evaluation and 
prediction of DDIs during different phases of drug devel-
opment and regulatory evaluation is critical to mitigate 
this risk.Cytokines are a class of secreted small proteins (~5– 25 
kDa) that regulates the cell survival, growth, differenti-
ation, and effector function.1 Some cytokines, especially 
pro- inflammatory cytokines, are elevated during host im-
mune responses to inflammation, infection, trauma, or 
cancer, and play an important role by controlling immune 
cell maturation, growth, and responsiveness. There is 
long-  standing evidence for cytokine-  drug interaction with 
early clinical evidence in the 1970s, which demonstrated Received: 12 December 2022 | Revised: 21 February 2023 | Accepted: 1 March 2023

It is well- recognized that therapeutic proteins (TPs) with pro- inflammatory ac-
tivities elevate the pro- inflammatory cytokines and result in cytokine- drug in-
teractions. In the current review, several pro- inflammatory cytokines, including 
IL- 2, IL- 6, IFN- γ, and TNF- α, as well as an anti- inflammatory cytokine IL- 10, 
were summarized for their respective effect on major cytochrome P450 enzymes 
and efflux transporter PgP. Pro- inflammatory cytokines are generally associated 
with suppression of CYP enzymes across assay systems but have varied effect on 
Pgp expression levels and activities depending on the individual cytokines and 
assay systems, whereas IL- 10 had no significant impact on CYP enzymes and 
P- gp. A cocktail drug- drug interaction (DDI) study design could be an ideal ap-
proach for simultaneously assess the impact of TPs with pro- inflammatory activi-
ties on multiple CYP enzymes. Clinical DDI studies using the cocktail approach 
have been conducted for several TPs with pro- inflammatory activities and for 
those TPs with pro- inflammatory activities which had no clinical DDI study con-
ducted, languages for potential DDI risk due to cytokine- drug interaction were 
included in the label. Up to date drug cocktails, including clinically validated and 
unvalidated for DDI assessment, were summarized in this review. Most clinically 
validated cocktails focused either on CYP enzymes or transporters. Additional 
effort was needed to validate a cocktail to include both the major CYP enzymes 
and key transporters. In silico methods for assessment of the DDI for TPs with 
pro- inflammatory activities were also discussed.

DDI FOR THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS
that acute inflammatory responses (associated with cy -
tokine release) to infection or tissue injury could lead to 
altered drug pharmacokinetics.2– 4 Quinine exposure was 
increased during induced malaria and induced fever, and 
theophylline had a longer half- life and therefore higher 
exposure during acute respiratory viral illness.3,4 With 
the advancement in the knowledge of cytokines and drug 
metabolism, direct link of cytokines and drug metaboliz-
ing enzymes were identified. For instance, interleukin 6 
(IL- 6) was found to be critical in reduction of cytochromes 
P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A5, and CYP3A11 
mRNA levels during turpentine- induced inflammation 
but not during LPS- mediated inflammation in mice.5 In 
general, cytokines downregulate CYP enzyme levels, re -
duce CYP enzyme substrates metabolism, and increase 
drug exposures.
Therapeutic proteins (TPs) with pro- inflammatory 
activities are a class of TPs with the properties either as 
pro- inflammatory cytokines, such as peginterferon, or as 
pro- inflammatory cytokine modulators, such as blinatum-
omab. By definition, TPs with pro- inflammatory activities 
could result in persistent or transient elevation of cytokine 
levels in the body, therefore, administration of TPs with 
pro- inflammatory activities could lead to DDIs with co- 
administered drugs owing to the cytokine-  drug interac-
tion.6,7 Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
draft guidance on “Drug-  drug interaction assessment for 
therapeutic proteins” laid out recommendations regarding 
assessing DDI risks for TPs.8 For TPs as pro- inflammatory 
cytokines, a clinical DDI study is recommended, and, for 
TPs as pro- inflammatory cytokine modulators, a clinical 
DDI study may not be conducted but label language to in-
clude potential CYP/transporter mediated DDIs.
The objectives of the current review are to provide a 
summary of key pro- inflammatory cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 6, 
TNF- α, and IFN- γ) and their effect on major CYP enzymes 
and efflux transporter P-  glycoprotein (P-  gp); clinically ob -
served DDIs for TPs with pro- inflammatory activities; pos -
sible drug cocktails for clinical DDI study to evaluate such 
DDIs; and in silico methods for assessment of such DDIs.
Cytokines effect on CYP enzymes and 
transporters
IL- 2
IL- 2 is a 15.5- 16- kDa four- α- helix- bundle cytokine, se-
creted primarily by antigen- stimulated CD4+ T cells, 
and also can be secreted by CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and 
activated dendritic cells.9 IL- 2 plays an important role in 
immune homeostasis and activation via stimulation both 
regulatory T cells and cytotoxic effector T cells.IL- 2 treatment of cryopreserved human hepatocytes 
had no significant impact on either mRNA levels or en-
zyme activities for CYP1A2, 2C9, or 3A4, but modestly 
decreased CYP2B6 (mRNA only) and CYP2C19 (enzyme 
activity only) by less than 25% (Table  1).10 On the contrary, 
the CYP2D6 mRNA expression increased ~50%, whereas 
CYP2D6 enzyme activity decreased ~22%.10 In primary 
human hepatocyte culture, IL- 2 was shown to have tran-
sient suppression of CYP3A activity, but demonstrated a 
sustained and concentration-  dependent 50% to 70% sup -
pression of CYP3A activity in hepatocyte/Kupffer cell 
coculture.11 Indinavir, primarily eliminated by CYP3A4 
metabolism, was found to have significant increase in 
area under the curve (AUC; 88% increase on day 5 vs. day 
1) after IL- 2 infusion in patients infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus.12 In addition, high-  dose daily 
administration (9 or 12*106 units/m2) of IL- 2 in patients 
with hepatic metastases from colon or rectum carcinomas 
resulted in significant reduction of total CYP enzyme pro -
tein level by 34%, CYP1A2 protein level by 37%, CYP2C 
protein level by 45%, CYP2E1 protein level by 60%, and 
CYP3A4 protein level by 39%.13
IL- 2 significantly reduced P-  gp mRNA expression in 
human colon carcinoma cell lines Lo VO, HT115, and 
SW480 cells, but had no effect on P-  gp expression in 
LS174T cells (Table  2).14 In another two human colon 
carcinoma cells, HCT15 and HCT116, a transient and re -
versible reduction of P-  gp mRNA and protein levels when 
incubated with IL- 2 was observed.15 In a mouse model, 
chronic IL- 2 treatment led to a significant decrease of 57% 
in P-  gp protein expression but no marked differences in 
P- gp mRNA level in the intestines, and, as a result, IL- 2 
pretreatment increased orally administered P-  gp substrate 
digoxin exposure by 2.8- fold in mice.16 Incubation of IL- 2 
with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPB -
MCs) resulted in reduced CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA 
and protein levels; in contrast, IL- 2 increased the P-  gp 
mRNA level to ~4.7- fold and protein level to ~2- fold, and 
resulted in reduced cellular accumulation of digoxin by 
17% and saquinavir by 28%.17 In another study using hPB -
MCs, IL- 2 incubation was shown to significantly increase 
P- gp mRNA and protein levels in lymphocytes, and flow 
cytometry further confirmed that P-  gp expression was sig -
nificantly augmented on CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells.18
IL- 6
IL- 6 is a 21- 26- kDa four- α- helix- bundle cytokine with an 
additional short α- helix in the CD loop, secreted primar-
ily by various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial 
cells, macrophages, T cells, and myocytes.19 IL- 6 plays an 
important role in host defense through the stimulation 924 |

DDI FOR THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS
of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune 
reactions.19
IL- 6 was shown to have significant suppression of 
CYP3A activity (~80%– 90%) in both human primary he -
patocyte culture and hepatocyte/Kupffer cell coculture 
(Table  1).11 In another study with primary human hepato -
cytes, IL- 6 was shown to significantly reduce the mRNA 
levels of all the CYP isoforms tested (CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
3A4, and 2B6), with the least at ~35% for CYP2C9 and 
the greatest reduction at ~90% for CYP3A4.20 IL- 6 also re -
duced CYP2B6, 2C9, and 3A4 protein levels by ~50– 80%.20 
Similarly, co- incubation of primary human hepatocytes 
with IL- 6 downregulated the major CYP enzymes mRNA 
by at least 40%, with CYP1A2 decreased by greater than 
75%, CYP3A4 by greater than 80%, CYP2C9 by greater 
than 60%, and CYP2D6 by ~50%, and P-  gp mRNA de -
creased by ~40%; similar findings were observed in 
HepaRG cells with significant downregulation by at least 
60% for almost all P450 isoforms with co- incubation of IL- 
6, but only marginal reduction in the P-  gp mRNA level.21 
Consistently, IL- 6 treatment significantly reduced the en-
zymes activities of P450s 1A2, 2B6, 2C8/9/19, and 3A4 in 
HepaRG cells, and markedly reduced the enzymes’ activi-
ties in primary human hepatocyte but not statistically sig -
nificant due to high interindividual variability among the 
three donors.21 IL- 6 treatment of cryopreserved human he -
patocytes also significantly decreased enzyme activities of 
all six CYP isoforms examined (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, and 3A4), ranging from the least at 22% for CYP1A2 
to the greatest at 76% for CYP3A4.10 The CYP mRNA ex -
pression reduction was similar to the decrease in enzyme 
activity, except that CYP2D6 enzyme activity decreased by 
39%, but the mRNA level increased by 2.4- fold.10
IL- 6 treatment with Caco- 2 cells, a model of the in-
testinal epithelial barrier, had reduced CYP3A4 mRNA 
expression by ~15% (Table  1), and increased P-  gp mRNA 
expression by ~20% (Table  2).22 Whereas, in the human 
hepatoma cell line HuH7, IL- 6 treatment significantly 
reduced P-  gp mRNA level ~35% and transporter activity 
by ~20%, but did not impact P-  gp mRNA, protein expres -
sion or transporter activity in HepG2 cells.23 IL- 6 treat -
ment with primary human hepatocyte modestly reduced 
the P-  gp mRNA level by ~35% but had no impact on the 
protein level.24 Incubation of IL- 6 with hPBMCs had no 
significant impact on CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and P-  gp mRNA 
levels but slightly reduced CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 pro -
tein levels, and increased the P-  gp protein level.17 In the 
human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 cell line, in 
vitro model of the human blood– brain barrier (BBB), IL- 6 
treatment slightly decreased the P-  gp mRNA level by 21% 
and had no significant impact on protein expression, and 
transporter activity.25 Similar findings were observed in 
another study, IL- 6 treatment with hCMEC/D3 cell line Cytokines Assay system CYP1A2 CYP2B6 CYP2C8 CYP2C9 CYP2C19 CYP2D6 CYP3A4 References

DDI FOR THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS
reduced the P-  gp mRNA level by 43%, but only had mild 
modification of P-  gp transporter activity.26
IFN- γ
IFN- γ is a dimerized cytokine, secreted primarily by T 
helper cell type 1 (Th1) cells, CD8+  T cells, B cells, NK 
cells, and antigen presenting cells (monocytes, mac-
rophages, and dendritic cells).27 The monomer has a 
molecular weight of 20– 25 kDa, and it is composed of a 
core of six- α- helix- bundle and an extended C- terminal 
region. IFN- γ plays an important role in host defense by 
mediating both innate and adaptive immune responses, 
also, IFN- γ can exert both antitumor and pro- tumor 
effects.
IFN- γ significantly reduced CYP2C8, 3A4, and 2B6 
by ~50% to 90%, but had no significant effect on 2C9 and 
2C19 mRNA in primary human hepatocytes (Table  1).20 
IFN- γ also reduced CYP2B6, 2C9, and 3A4 protein lev -
els by ~60– 80%.20 Incubation of IFN- γ with hPBMCs 
resulted in reduced CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA and 
protein levels; in contrast, IFN- γ dramatically increased 
P- gp mRNA and protein levels, and resulted in reduced 
cellular accumulation of digoxin by 26% and saquinavir 
by 30%.17
IFN- γ significantly reduced P-  gp mRNA expression 
in Lo VO, HT115, and SW480 cells, but had no effect on 
P- gp expression in LS174T cells (Table  2).14 IFN- γ upreg -
ulated P-  gp expression and increased P-  gp transport ac-
tivity in a dose-  and time-  dependent manner in human 
peripheral blood monocyte-  derived macrophages. The 
upregulation of P-  gp by IFN- γ is the specific response 
of primary macrophages, as it has no impact on P-  gp 
expression in primary lymphocytes and monocytic cell 
lines.28 IFN- γ treatment with Caco- 2 cells had no signifi-
cant impact on CYP3A4 mRNA expression, but modestly 
increased P-  gp mRNA expression by ~ 20%.22 In another 
study with Caco- 2 cells, IFN- γ treatment increased the 
P- gp mRNA to 2.5- fold, and a time-  dependent increase 
of protein level with maximum increase ~ 50% at 24 h, 
but did not impact transporter activity.29 Similarly, Dixit 
et al.30 reported that IFN- γ increased P-  gp protein level in 
a concentration-  and time-  dependent manner in Caco- 2 
cells with maximum increase by approximately twofold. 
In both immortalized and primary human brain micro -
vascular endothelial cell lines (iHBMEC and pHBMEC), 
another in vitro BBB model, IFN- γ treatment increased 
P- gp mRNA expression transiently with maximum effect 
observed at 24 h but had no effect on the P-  gp protein 
level. In addition, IFN- γ treatment transiently decreased 
P- gp transporter activity with a maximum effect ob -
served at 12 h.31TNF- α
TNF- α exits as two forms, a 26 kDa transmembrane form 
and a soluble 17 kDa form, which is the extracellular do-
main cleaved from the transmembrane form.32 Both forms 
are biologically active but require trimerization for the ac-
tivity. TNF- α is predominantly produced by macrophages 
and monocytes. TNF- α plays important roles in acute and 
chronic inflammation, immunostimulation, resistance to 
infection agents, antitumor response, sleep regulation, 
embryonic development, and inducing necrotic or apop-
totic cell death.33
In primary human hepatocytes, TNF- α significantly re -
duced the mRNA levels of CYP2C8 and 3A4 by 60– 80%, 
but had no significant effect on CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2B6 
mRNA (Table  1).20 TNF- α also reduced CYP2B6, 2C9, and 
3A4 protein levels by ~60– 80%.20 In cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes, TNF- α treatment also significantly decreased 
enzyme activities of all six CYP isoforms examined 
(CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), with greater 
reduction (>70%) for CYP1A2/2C19/3A4 and relatively 
smaller reduction (<50%) for CYP2B6/2C9/2D6.10 The 
reduction of CYP mRNA expression levels was similar to 
the decrease in enzyme activities for CYP1A2/2D6/3A4, 
whereas CYP2B6/2C9/2C19 mRNA levels were rela-
tively unchanged.10 Similarly, in HepaRG cells, TNF- α 
treatment significantly reduced all major P450s isoform 
mRNA levels by at least 40%, but only slightly reduced 
P- gp mRNA by ~12%; the enzymatic activities of P450s 
1A2, 2B6, 2C8/9/19, and 3A4 were also reduced with most 
at greater than 80% reduction except about 30% reduction 
for CYP2C8.21 In contrast, incubation of TNF- α with hPB -
MCs significantly increased the mRNA and protein lev -
els of CYP2B6 and P-  gp, but had no impact on CYP3A4 
mRNA and protein levels.17
TNF- α significantly reduced P-  gp mRNA expression in 
Lo VO, HT115, and SW480 cells, but had no effect on P-  gp 
expression in LS174T cells (Table  2).14 Mixed results were 
reported on the impact of TNF- α treatment on Caco- 2 
cells, Bertilsson et al.22 indicated that TNF- α treatment 
had no significant impact on CYP3A4 and P-  gp mRNA 
expression; whereas, Belliard demonstrated that TNF- α 
treatment resulted in a time-  dependent decrease of the 
P- gp mRNA level, with maximum reduction ~56% at 48 h, 
and also had significant but moderate (~20%) reduction 
in transporter activity.29 In the human hepatoma cell line, 
HuH7 and HepG2 cells, TNF- α treatment significantly re -
duced the P-  gp mRNA level ~25% and transporter activity 
by ~35%.23 TNF- α treatment with primary human hepato -
cyte had no impact on either the P-  gp mRNA level or the 
protein level.24 In the human hCMEC/D3 cell line, TNF- α 
treatment significantly increased P-  gp mRNA level by 49% 
and protein expression, but had no effect on transporter 928 |

activity.25 In another in vitro human BBB model, iHBMEC 
and pHBMEC cells, TNF- α treatment also increased P-  gp 
mRNA expression transiently with maximum effect ob -
served at 24 h in iHBMEC and consistently increased P-  gp 
mRNA expression in pHBMEC, but had no effect on the 
P- gp protein level in both cell lines.31 Interestingly, TNF- α 
treatment transiently decreased P-  gp transporter activity 
with maximum effect observed at 12 h in iHBMEC cells, 
and resulted in more consistent reduction of P-  gp trans -
porter activity in pHBMEC cells.31
IL- 10
IL- 10 is a dimerized anti- inflammatory cytokine, secreted 
primarily by monocytes, type- II T helper cells (TH2), 
CD4 + CD25+ T regulatory cells, γδT cells, and activated B 
cells.34 The monomer has a molecular weight of ~18 kDa, 
consisting of a core of six- α- helix- bundle. IL- 10 plays an 
immunoregulatory role and has inhibitory effects on pro- 
inflammatory cytokine production and function.
In general, incubation of IL- 10 with hPBMC had no 
significant impact on the mRNA and protein levels of 
CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and P-  gp, except that there is a tran-
sient slight increase in the CYP3A4 mRNA level (Tables  1 
and 2).17 In addition, IL- 10 treatment in 12 healthy vol-
unteers did not significantly alter CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2D6 activities, but slightly reduced CYP3A activity by 
~12%.35
Clinical DDI studies involving TPs with 
pro- inflammatory activity
Peginterferon alfa- 2a, a covalent conjugate of recombinant 
alfa- 2a interferon with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, 
was approved for chronic hepatitis B and C. Peginterferon 
alfa- 2a was found to have no significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics (PKs) of representative drugs metabo-
lized by CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), 
CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), or CYP3A4 (dapsone); and was 
associated with an inhibition of CYP1A2 and increased 
theophylline AUC 25% in healthy volunteers.36,37
Peginterferon alfa- 2b, a covalent conjugate of recom-
binant alfa- 2b interferon with a PEG chain, was approved 
for chronic hepatitis C. Peginterferon alfa- 2b increased 
caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) AUC 18– 39% in healthy and 
chronic hepatitis C subjects depending on the dose reg -
imen, increased dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) 
AUC 103% in healthy subjects but had no impact in 
chronic hepatitis C subjects, and increased desipramine 
(CYP2D6 substrate) AUC 30% in healthy subjects.38,39 
Peginterferon alfa- 2b had no significant impact on the PKs of tolbutamide (CYP2C9 substrate), midazolam 
(CYP3A4 substrate), and dapsone (N- acetyltransferase 
substrate).38,39 In another report, high-  dose interferon al-
fa- 2b was found to reduce CYP1A2 activity by 60% in pa-
tients with high- risk melanoma.40
No clinical DDI information have been reported 
for the other approved therapeutic proteins with pro- 
inflammatory activity, including interferon alfacon- 1, 
interferon gamma- 1b, interferon beta- 1b, TNF- α, aldesleu-
kin, denileukin diftitox, blinatumomab, tebentafusp- tebn, 
mosunetuzumab, and teclistamab-  cqyv.41– 51 However, 
interferon gamma- 1b had label language describing that 
the interferon gamma had demonstrated reduction in 
hepatic CYP450 concentrations in rodents, which could 
lead to suppression of the hepatic metabolism of certain 
drugs.42 Interferon beta- 1b also had label language de -
scribing caution when interferon beta- 1b in combination 
with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic 
index and largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome 
P450 system for clearance, as interferon was reported to 
be associated with reduced activity of hepatic CYP450 en-
zymes.44 Blinatumomab, tebentafusp, mosunetuzumab, 
and teclistamab had label languages describing transient 
release of cytokines that may suppress CYP450 enzymes 
which could result in DDI risk.48– 51
Cocktail studies
Clinically validated cocktails involving CYP 
mediated DDIs
Nine clinically validated (drugs within the cocktail have 
no mutual interactions in clinical study) cocktails with at 
least five CYP enzymes were shown in Table  3, includ-
ing the publication time for the final version of the cock-
tail, drugs in the cocktail and their doses/routes, and the 
applications of the cocktail with no change or minimal 
changes.
The major CYP enzymes assessed in these cocktails 
included CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4.52– 63 
Caffeine was selected as the CYP1A2 probe substrate in all 
these cocktails. Four CYP2C9 probe substrate drugs were 
used in these cocktails, including flurbiprofen, losartan, 
tolbutamide, and warfarin. Mephenytoin and omeprazole 
were used as the CYP2C19 probe substrates with omepra-
zole predominantly used. Debrisoquine, metoprolol, and 
dextromethorphan were used as the CYP2D6 probe sub -
strates. Dapsone, quinine, and midazolam were used as the 
CYP3A4 probe substrates with midazolam predominantly 
used. CYP2B6 was only assessed in the Basel cocktail and 
Geneva cocktail with efavirenz and bupropion as the re -
spective probe substrate.61,63 In addition, the Pittsburgh    | 929

cocktail, the Zhu cocktail, and the Blakey cocktail also 
included CYP2E1 with chlorzoxazone as the probe sub -
strate.52,54,58 Despite that some cocktails shared the same 
probe substrate, the dose amount and dosing route could 
be different. For example, midazolam was dosed intrave -
nously in the Blakey cocktail and the Cooperstown 5 + 1 
cocktail and was dosed orally in the other cocktails. All 
the individual tested cocktails showed that there were no 
mutual metabolic interactions among the included drugs 
at the respective doses, except that whereas caffeine, losar -
tan, omeprazole, and quinine had no significant change 
when administered together compared with administered 
alone, an inhibition of debrisoquine metabolism was ob -
served when concurrent administration of the five drugs 
in the Karolinska cocktail.55 The Inje cocktail was further 
validated by the typical CYP inducer rifampicin or inhibi-
tors cimetidine and fluvoxamine, and the degrees of inter -
action are consistent with the single agent studies.64
Clinically validated cocktails involving 
transporter mediated DDIs
Three clinically validated cocktails involving transporters 
were shown in Table  S1, including the publication time 
for the final version of the cocktail, drugs in the cocktail 
and their doses/routes, and the applications of the cocktail 
with no change or minimal changes.
A five-  drug microdose probe drug cocktail (here 
named as the Microdose cocktail) consisting of 10  μg 
midazolam (CYP3A), 375 μg dabigatran etexilate (P-  gp), 
10 μg pitavastatin (OATP1B1), 50 μg rosuvastatin (BCRP 
and OATP1B1/1B3), 100 μg atorvastatin (CYP3A, BCRP, 
OATP1B1/1B3, and P-  gp) was qualified by clinical DDI 
studies with inducer/inhibitors of rifampin, itraconazole, 
and clarithromycin.65 The observed DDIs were consis -
tent with historical observed ones and/or in agreement 
with theoretical expectations, with the exception that the 
observed DDI for dabigatran was about twofold higher 
for microdose compared to that of conventional dosing, 
which could be due to P-  gp mediated nonlinearity in the 
PKs of dabigatran.65
Stopfer et al.66 evaluated a four-  drug cocktails 
(here named as the Stopfer transporter cocktail) con-
sisting of 0.25 mg digoxin (P-  gp), 5  mg furosemide 
(OAT1 and OAT3), 500 mg metformin (OCT2, MATE1, 
and MATE2- K), and 10  mg rosuvastatin (OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, and BCRP) for evaluation of transporter me -
diated DDI. Approximately 40% increase in rosuvastatin 
exposure was observed which could be due to the met -
formin and furosemide had an effect on rosuvastatin.66 
As a result, reduced doses of furosemide and metformin 
in this four-  drug cocktail was further tested, with 0.25 mg digoxin, 1 mg furosemide, 10 mg metformin, and 10 mg 
rosuvastatin, and no mutual interaction was observed.67 
A follow- up study further evaluated this cocktail with 
four common transporter inhibitors, rifampin (rosuvas -
tatin inhibitor), probenecid (furosemide inhibitor), ci-
metidine (metformin inhibitor), and verapamil (digoxin 
inhibitor). Generally, the DDIs between the transporter 
inhibitors and substrates were consistent with the his -
torical data, except that the effect of single dose ver -
apamil on digoxin was less than the effect observed from 
multiple verapamil dose studies.68
Trueck et al.69 evaluated a five-  drug transporter cock -
tails (here named as the Trueck transporter cocktail) 
consisting of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil (OAT1), 100 mg sita-
gliptin (OAT3), 500 mg metformin (OCT2, MATE1, and 
MATE2- K), 2 mg pitavastatin (OATP1B1), and 0.5 mg di-
goxin (P-  gp), and no significant mutual interactions were 
observed.
Clinically used cocktails without 
validation source
In addition to the validated cocktails, other cocktails were 
also used for evaluation of complicated DDIs, although no 
clinical data can be identified to illustrate whether there is 
mutual interaction among the cocktail drugs. The unvali-
dated cocktails can be found in Table S2.
In silico methods
The cocktail DDI studies could be helpful for evaluating 
the potential DDI risks for TPs with pro- inflammatory ac-
tivities with the advantage of simultaneous evaluation of 
multiple CYP enzymes. In silico methods might also be a 
viable approach to assess such DDIs.
Machavaram et al.70 developed a physiologically- based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for IL- 6 incorporating in 
vitro IL6 CYP suppression kinetics from hepatocytes and 
evaluated the impact of IL- 6 on CYP3A4 substrates (sim-
vastatin and cyclosporine). A steady-  state concentration 
of 100 pg/mL IL- 6 was associated with increased exposure 
of simvastatin, and the predicted increase in AUC is com-
parable with the observed data (59% vs. 58%, respectively) 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; patients with 
RA had elevated IL- 6 around 100 ng/mL).70,71 Whereas, 
a steady-  state concentration of 500 pg/mL IL- 6 resulted 
in cyclosporine exposure increase and the predicted in-
crease in AUC was consistent with the observed (45% vs. 
39%, respectively) in patients with bone marrow trans -
plant (BMT; patients with BMT had higher IL- 6 around 
500 pg/mL).70,72 However, in another set of patients with    | 931
DDI FOR THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS
BMT, the predicted cyclosporine increase by IL- 6 was 
less than clinically observed (1.6– 1.7- fold vs. 3– 5- fold). 
Machavaram et al. further used this model with modifica-
tion to predict the change of the exposure of several CYP 
probe substrates, CYP3A4 (simvastatin and midazolam), 
CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (S-  warfarin), CYP2C19 (ome -
prazole), and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) in subjects 
with RA (steady-  state IL6 concentrations of 50 or 100 pg/
mL were used) and compared with healthy subjects and 
found reasonable agreement.73,74
Xu et al.75 developed a PBPK model to predict the DDI 
potential of blinatumomab, a TP with pro- inflammatory 
activity which can transiently elevate multiple cytokines, 
including IL- 6, IL- 10, and IFN-  gamma. The model focused 
on IL- 6 mediated DDI and time-  concentration profile of 
IL- 6 from patients with non- Hodgkin's lymphoma receiv -
ing blinatumomab was simulated and in vitro IL- 6 CYP 
suppression kinetics were incorporated into the model. 
The predicted exposure increases for sensitive substrates 
of CYP3A4 (simvastatin and midazolam), CYP1A2 (the -
ophylline and caffeine), and CYP2C9 (S-  warfarin) ranged 
from 1.2-  to 1.9- fold, and lasted less than 1 week, indicat -
ing transient and weak DDI potential for blinatumomab.75
The exposure of several CYP probe substrate drugs 
were altered in patients with RA at pre-  and post- 
sirukumab (an anti- IL- 6 monoclonal antibody) treat -
ment.76 Midazolam, omeprazole, and S-  warfarin exposure 
reduced about 33%, 40%, and 18%, respectively; whereas 
caffeine exposure increased ~25%.76 A PBPK model was 
used to predict the impact of elevated IL- 6 and sirukumab 
on CYP enzymes in patients with RA. The predicted expo -
sure of several CYP probe substrates, caffeine (CYP1A2), 
S- warfarin (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), and mid-
azolam (CYP3A4) in patients with RA pre-  and post- 
sirukumab treatment (IL- 6 assumed to be 50 and 0 pg/mL 
for pre-  and post-  sirukumab treatment, respectively) were 
consistent with the observed from the sirukumab clinical 
TP- DDI study.74
The PBPK model was also used to simulate IL- 6 in-
duced P-  gp activity reduction in BBB and examine its 
impact on P-  gp substrate digoxin exposure in the brain.26 
The simulation showed that the digoxin brain exposure is 
marginally affected with IL- 6 treatment (a nonsignificant 
4% increase of AUCinf).
DISCUSSION
There is an increasing number of TPs, including TPs with 
pro- inflammatory activities in the different stages of drug 
development. In this review, we examined the DDI poten-
tial for TPs with pro- inflammatory activities via cytokine- 
drug interaction. Specifically, several key cytokines and their impact on major CYP enzymes and P- gp, the clini-
cal DDI information of TPs with pro- inflammatory ac-
tivities, drug cocktails for clinical DDI studies, and in 
silico methods for evaluating clinical DDI potential were 
summarized.
Among the pro- inflammatory cytokines examined, 
IL- 6 exhibited consistent and profound effect in reduc-
ing the major CYP enzymes mRNA and protein levels as 
well as enzymatic activities across different assay systems, 
except that CYP2D6 mRNA in cryopreserved human he -
patocyte was increased and CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA 
in hPBMCs were not changed. However, CYP2D6 activ -
ity in cryopreserved human hepatocytes and CYP2B6 
and CYP3A4 protein levels in hPBMCs were reduced 
with IL- 6 treatment. Compared to IL- 6, IFN- γ and TNF- α 
showed slightly less effect but also significantly reduced 
the mRNA, protein levels, and enzymatic activities of 
the major CYP enzymes in most assay systems. IL- 2 had 
the least activity in suppression of CYP enzymes, and 
the mechanism in suppression of CYP enzymes for IL- 2 
might be different from IL- 6, IFN- γ, and TNF- α, because 
IL- 2 had minor or only transient effect on CYP enzymes 
in primary or cryopreserved human hepatocytes but sig -
nificantly reduced CYP3A4 activity in primary human he -
patocyte/Kupffer coculture; in contrast, IL- 6, IFN- γ, and 
TNF- α had similar effect on CYP enzymes in primary or 
cryopreserved human hepatocytes with/without Kupffer 
coculture. Therefore, IL- 2 might suppress CYP enzymes 
in hepatocytes indirectly through inducing IL- 6 and other 
pro- inflammatory cytokines in Kupffer cells.11 In addition 
to the in vitro assay systems, patients with hepatic metas -
tases treated with IL- 2 resulted in CYP enzyme reduction 
in a clinical study.13 For comparison purpose, we also ex -
amined the effect of an anti- inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10, 
on CYP enzymes. Not surprisingly, IL- 10 had negligible 
effect on CYP enzymes in hPBMCs and in humans from 
a clinical study.
In addition to the CYP enzymes, the impact of cyto -
kines on transporter P-  gp was also examined. The impact 
of cytokines on transporter P-  gp is varied and depen-
dent on assay systems. In general, the pro- inflammatory 
cytokines IL- 2, IL- 6, IFN- γ, and TNF- α increased P-  gp 
mRNA and protein levels in hPBMC; whereas the im-
pact of different cytokines on the other assay systems, 
including human colon carcinoma cell lines, Caco- 2 
cells, hepatocyte, HepaG2 cells, and in vitro BBB model 
cells were varied and could be a reduction, no change, 
or increase. In addition, IL- 10 had no impact on P+gp. 
In this review, we only focused on P-  gp as a prototypical 
transporter. However, other transporters can also be af-
fected by the pro- inflammatory cytokines. For instance, 
IL- 6 and TNF- α significantly reduced BCRP mRNA level 
and activity in the human hCMEC/D3 cell line.25 TNF- α 932 |   
YU et al.
and IL- 2 downregulated NTCP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OATB2B1, OCT1, and OAT2 mRNA levels, and reduced 
NTCP, OATP1B1 protein levels and NTCP, OATP, and 
OCT1 transporter activities; IL- 6 decreased mRNA level 
of MDR1, MRP2, and BCRP, and also MRP2 and BCRP 
protein expression in primary human hepatocyte.24 TNF- α 
but not IL- 6 reduced BSEP mRNA level and increased 
BCRP protein expression, and TNF- α and IL- 6 increased 
MRP3 protein level.24
The current review focused on several key pro- 
inflammatory cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 6, TNF- α, and IFN- γ) 
and anti- inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 for comparison. 
Other pro- inflammatory cytokines could also have impact 
on the CYP enzymes and transporters. For example, the -
ophylline (a CYP1A2 probe substrate) was shown to have 
a reduced clearance by ~26% in patients with chronic hep -
atitis C treated with interferon beta77; whereas, interferon 
beta had no significant effect on exposure of mephenytoin 
(CYP2C19 probe substrate) and debrisoquine (CYP2D6 
probe substrate) in patients with multiple sclerosis.78 In 
addition, incubation of Hepa- RG cells with IL- 1β resulted 
in significant reduction of the mRNA levels (>80%) and 
enzyme activities (>60%) for key CYP enzymes 1A2, 2B6, 
2C19, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4 as well as P-  gp mRNA level ~55%.
Despite numerous reports indicating the impact of 
pro- inflammatory cytokines on CYP enzymes and trans -
porters, limited clinical DDI studies were conducted for 
the approved TPs with pro- inflammatory activities, with 
the exception for Peginterferon alfa- 2a and Peginterferon 
alfa- 2b. However, most of the approved TPs with pro- 
inflammatory activities had label languages regarding 
the potential DDI due to suppression of CYP enzymes. 
The clinical DDI studies for Peginterferon alfa- 2a and 
Peginterferon alfa- 2b adopted cocktail approach, which 
enables assessment of DDIs for multiple CYP enzymes 
simultaneously to increase study efficiency and cost sav -
ing.39,79 In addition, due to the cytokine effect on the CYP 
enzymes, the CYP enzymes are suppressed in certain dis -
eases with elevated pro- inflammatory cytokines, such as 
plaque psoriasis and RA. Therefore, drugs used to treat 
these diseases could often result in disease-  drug interac-
tion as the treatment normalized the cytokines and the 
CYP enzymes levels and thus altered the exposure of CYP 
enzymes substrate drugs post- treatment compared to pre -
treatment. Clinical DDI studies have been conducted to 
evaluate such disease-  drug interactions, some using the 
cocktail approach.71,76,80– 82
In this review, we summarized the most up- to- date 
validated cocktails for CYP enzymes and validated cock -
tails involving transporters, as well as some other cocktails 
used in the clinical DDI studies, although no validation 
source can be identified. Almost all the validated cocktails were either for CYP enzymes or for transporters, except 
that a microdose cocktail included CYP3A4 probe sub -
strate and several transporters probe substrates.65 Efforts 
have been made to combine the CYP cocktails with trans -
porter cocktails. For example, Kwon et al.83 developed and 
validated a 10- probe drug cocktail, including five major 
CYP probe substrates and five transporters probe sub -
strates in rat. Bosilkovska et al.84 explored the possibility 
to combine the Geneva cocktail (6 CYP enzymes) with fex -
ofenadine (P-  gp) and found that the Geneva cocktail co- 
administration with 25 mg fexofenadine resulted in 49% 
reduction in maximum concentration and 43% reduction 
in AUC0- 8 for fexofenadine; hence, fexofenadine cannot 
be combined with the Geneva cocktail. Currently, there 
is no validated cocktail in the clinic involving major CYP 
enzymes and transporters, although several unvalidated 
cocktails consisting of several major CYP enzymes and 
transporters were used in the clinical studies to assess the 
clinical DDIs (Table S2).
In silico methods have also been used to evaluate the 
complicated DDIs, whereas the population PK approach 
still needs clinical data to assess the DDIs, the bottom- up 
approach PBPK can directly extrapolate the clinical DDI 
with in vitro data. Current PBPK models for assessing 
cytokine-  drug DDIs all focus on IL- 6, whereas most of 
the models can reasonably predict the clinical DDIs based 
on in vitro determined CYP suppression kinetics retro -
spectively, Machavaram et al.70 showed that the PBPK 
model underpredicted exposure of cyclosporine in certain 
patients with BMT, which might be due to possible con-
tribution of other cytokines (e.g., TNF- α) in the overall 
suppression of CYP3A4 in these patients, and the PBPK 
model incorporating IL- 6 CYP3A4 suppression alone may 
underestimate the suppression effect. Therefore, addi-
tional efforts may be needed to further evaluate the PBPK 
models for the other pro- inflammatory cytokines and/or a 
PBPK model incorporating multiple pro- inflammatory cy -
tokines. Moreover, limited PBPK modeling is available to 
evaluate the DDI potential of TPs with pro- inflammatory 
activities with drugs via transporters, and such PBPK 
models need further development.
Considering the effect of pro- inflammatory cytokines 
on the major CYP enzymes and P-  gp, for TPs with pro- 
inflammatory activity, a clinical DDI study is recom-
mended for those TPs that can persistently elevate the 
cytokines and, in this case, the cocktail approach may be 
used owing to its efficient study design and cost saving; 
whereas for those TPs transiently elevating cytokines, a 
clinical DDI study may not be conducted and an in silico 
method may be used to assess such transient effect, and 
label language should incorporate the potential DDIs due 
to cytokine-  drug effect.   | 933
DDI FOR THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS
CONCLUSION
Potential DDI risk for TPs with pro- inflammatory activities 
via cytokine- drug interaction has been well- recognized. 
Pro- inflammatory cytokines are generally associated with 
suppression of CYP enzymes but have varied effects on 
P- gp expression levels and activities. The approved TPs 
with pro- inflammatory activities generally contain label 
languages for potential DDI risks due to cytokine el-
evation. Cocktail studies have been used to evaluate the 
complicated DDIs involving multiple CYP enzymes and 
transporters with the advantage of efficiency and cost sav-
ing, and it is a viable approach to assess the DDI for TPs 
with pro- inflammatory activities. In silico methods are 
also viable approaches to assess the DDIs for TPs with pro- 
inflammatory activities.
