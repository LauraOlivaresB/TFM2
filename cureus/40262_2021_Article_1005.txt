Abstract
Combined antiretroviral treatments have significantly improved the morbidity and mortality related to HIV infection, thus 
transforming HIV infection into a chronic disease; however, the efficacy of antiretroviral treatments is highly dependent on 
the ability of infected individuals to adhere to life-long drug combination therapies. A major milestone in HIV treatment is 
the marketing of the long-acting intramuscular antiretroviral drugs cabotegravir and rilpivirine, allowing for infrequent drug 
administration, with the potential to improve adherence to therapy and treatment satisfaction. Intramuscular administration 
of cabotegravir and rilpivirine leads to differences in pharmacokinetics and drug–drug interaction (DDI) profiles compared 
with oral administration. A notable difference is the long elimination half-life with intramuscular administration, which 
reaches 5.6–11.5 weeks for cabotegravir and 13–28 weeks for rilpivirine, compared with 41 and 45 h, respectively, with their 
oral administration. Cabotegravir and rilpivirine have a low potential to cause DDIs, however these drugs can be victims 
of DDIs. Cabotegravir is mainly metabolized by UGT1A1, and rilpivirine is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, therefore 
these agents are susceptible to DDIs with inhibitors, and particularly inducers of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Intramuscular 
administration of cabotegravir and rilpivirine has the advantage of eliminating DDIs occurring at the gastrointestinal level, 
however interactions can still occur at the hepatic level. This review provides insight on the intramuscular administration of 
drugs and summarizes the pharmacology of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine. Particular emphasis is placed on DDI 
profiles after oral and intramuscular administration of these antiretroviral drugs.

The use of three-drug antiretroviral combinations has sig-
nificantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated 
with HIV infection, thus transforming HIV infection into a 
chronic disease. Treated people living with HIV (PLWH) 
nowadays have a life expectancy close to that of the gen-
eral population [1 –3]. In recent years, the efficacy of dual 
antiretroviral regimens has been investigated in an attempt to 
reduce life-long drug exposure and prevent toxicities. Some 
drug combinations (e.g. dolutegravir-rilpivirine, lamivudine-
dolutegravir, lopinavir/ritonavir-lamivudine) have proved to be efficient in treatment-naïve HIV-infected individuals 
as well as in individuals with stable virologic suppression 
[4–6].
Treatment of HIV infection generally requires adherence 
to once-daily antiretroviral drug dosing. Incomplete treat-
ment adherence can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant 
HIV strains resulting in loss of virologic control, and placing 
PLWH not only at risk of morbidity and mortality but also at 
risk of transmitting HIV. The concerns over both long-term 
adherence to treatment and dosing convenience have led to 
the development of injectable long-acting antiretroviral for -
mulations allowing once-monthly or bimonthly administra-
tion. Antiretroviral drug attributes required for long-acting 
intramuscular administration include a high-level intrinsic 
antiviral activity, low systemic clearance, low aqueous solu-
bility, and a high melting point (permitting micronization or 
nanomilling and the development of injectable nanoparticle 
suspensions) [7 ]. The integrase inhibitor cabotegravir and 
the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
rilpivirine fulfil these requirements. The combination of 
these drugs successfully suppressed HIV with monthly or 836 D. Hodge et al.
Key Points  
Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine represents the first long-
acting injectable monthly or bimonthly regimen for the 
treatment of HIV infection in adults who are virologi-
cally stable and suppressed.
Intramuscular administration of cabotegravir and rilpiv -
irine exhibits absorption limited kinetics (flip-flop kinet-
ics), resulting in sustained plasma concentrations.
Drug–drug interactions occurring at the gastrointestinal 
tract as a result of chelation, changes in gastric pH, or 
inhibition/induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes or 
transporters are avoided with the intramuscular adminis-
tration of cabotegravir and rilpivirine.levels [12]. Thus, obesity may affect the exposure of drugs 
administered intramuscularly because of the difficulty in 
reaching the muscle through thicker layers of adipose tis-
sue. Of note, the Canadian and US product information for 
Cabenuva (long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine) advises 
using a longer needle when administering the product to 
patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, to 
ensure intramuscular delivery as opposed to subcutaneous 
delivery [13, 14]. The ECLAIR2 and HPTN 077 trials used 
a needle of 2 inches for participants with a BMI > 30 kg/
m2 and a needle of 1.5 inches for participants with a BMI 
< 30 kg/m2 [15, 16]; the ECLAIR2 trial noted changes in 
pharmacokinetic parameters associated with high BMI and/
or longer needle length. Maximal concentration (Cmax) and 
the area under the curve (AUC) were higher in participants 
with a BMI below the median, while the concentration at the 
end of the dosing interval (Ctrough) was lower [16], although 
phase III trials have shown that lower Ctrough does not persist 
through week 48 [17]. There are also gender differences in 
adipose layer thickness, which may result in different phar -
macokinetics between men and women, as reported for both 
intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine [15, 18]. Other 
factors affecting the absorption and bioavailability of intra-
muscular injections include exercise and local blood flow 
(with greater drug absorption in the case of increased blood 
flow in the muscle) [ 11]. The absorption process in the mus -
cle may also vary with aging, as indicated by differences in 
tobramycin pharmacokinetics in the young and elderly after 
intramuscular administration [19]. The pharmacokinetics of 
long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine have not yet been 
evaluated in elderly individuals.
Intramuscular administration allows a drug to bypass the 
gastrointestinal tract, thereby eliminating the risk of gut-
based DDIs (Fig.  1). Orally administered drugs may be 
subject to DDIs at the intestinal level due to several mecha-
nisms, including the following.
• Changes in gastric pH Antacids markedly reduce the 
absorption of rilpivirine since a low pH is required for 
its solubility [ 20]. Oral rilpivirine is contraindicated with 
proton pump inhibitors, whereas antacids can be admin -
istered 2 h before or 4 h after rilpivirine due to their 
shorter acid-neutralizing effect.
• Chelation All integrase inhibitors, including cabotegra-
vir, possess a chelating motif allowing binding to a diva-
lent cation in the active site of the HIV integrase. Thus, 
the divalent cations aluminium, calcium, magnesium, 
iron and zinc in antacids or mineral supplements can 
form a complex with integrase inhibitors at the intestinal 
level, thereby impairing their absorption [21]. The label 
recommends that products containing divalent cations bimonthly intramuscular administration in a phase IIb trial 
[8], thus leading to their clinical development.
Long-acting intramuscular formulations of cabotegravir 
and rilpivirine were first approved in March 2020 in Can-
ada for the treatment of HIV infection. These agents were 
subsequently approved by the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) in December 2020 and by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in January 2021. The intramuscular 
administration of antiretroviral drugs leads to differences in 
pharmacokinetics and drug–drug interaction (DDI) profiles 
compared with oral administration. This review provides 
insight on intramuscular administration of drugs and sum-
marizes the pharmacology of long-acting cabotegravir and 
rilpivirine. Particular emphasis is placed on DDI profiles 
after oral and intramuscular administration of these antiret-
roviral drugs.
2  Intramuscular Administration of Drugs
An intramuscular injection of a suspension or lipophilic 
solution creates a drug ‘depot’ in the muscle from which the 
drug is released for an extended period, allowing for infre-
quent drug administration [9 ]. Unlike oral administration, 
the elimination rate of intramuscularly administered drugs 
far exceeds the absorption rate, making the latter the driver 
of the elimination half-life  (t½; so-called flip-flop kinetics) 
[10].
The rich vascular supply of the muscle favours drug 
absorption [ 11]. A good intramuscular injection technique 
is therefore critical to ensure that the drug is not deposited in 
the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is less vas-
cular than muscle tissue, which may result in poor absorp-
tion and distribution of the drug, leading to suboptimal drug 837
PK and DDI with LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine
are administered 2 h before or 4 h after oral cabotegravir 
[13].
• Inhibition/induction of intestinal drug-metabolizing 
enzymes and/or intestinal transporters For instance, 
exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate rilpivirine is signifi-
cantly increased by darunavir/ritonavir due to the inhibi-
tion of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 [22].
Intramuscular administration of drugs allows absorption 
into the systemic bloodstream, bypassing first-pass metabo-
lism and in theory providing some level of protection against 
DDIs. In practice, no clinical studies have examined the dif-
ference in DDI magnitude between oral and intramuscular 
administration of antiretroviral drugs. DDI studies with 
intramuscular antiretrovirals are challenging in HIV-infected 
individuals. The risk of antiretroviral treatment (ART) toxic -
ity/failure that cannot be readily reversed given the nature of 
the long-acting treatment must be avoided. Novel approaches 
are required when designing a DDI study with injectable 
antiretroviral drugs. Of interest, on coadministration of 
levonorgestrel subcutaneous implant with the inducer efa -
virenz, levonorgestrel exposure was 47% after 24 weeks and 
57% after 48 weeks [23]. A comparable inducing effect was 
observed after oral administration since efavirenz reduced 
oral levonorgestrel exposure by 56% [24]. Furthermore, a 
modelling study predicted a comparable decrease in cabo-
tegravir and rilpivirine exposures after both intramuscular 
and oral administration in the presence of rifampicin [ 25]. 
Together, these data suggest that bypassing the gastrointes-
tinal tract does not mitigate the magnitude of DDIs with 
inducers. However, in case of inhibition, the magnitude 
of DDIs after intramuscular administration could possibly 
be less pronounced, particularly for rilpivirine, as bypass-
ing gut-based inhibition of CYP3A4 may result in lower 
bioavailability.3  Cabotegravir
3.1  Pharmacodynamics
A structural analogue of dolutegravir [26 ], cabotegravir 
inhibits the strand transfer step of viral complementary 
DNA (cDNA) integration [27] by binding to the active site 
of the HIV integrase [28]. Cabotegravir monotherapy was 
evaluated in treatment-naïve individuals at 5 mg and 30 mg 
once-daily for 10 days. The mean HIV RNA change from 
baseline was − 2.2 and − 2.3  log10 copies/mL for 5 mg and 
30 mg once daily. Pharmacodynamic analyses found that the 
HIV-RNA change from baseline was associated with cabo-
tegravir Ctrough, with a maximum effect (Emax) estimated to 
be 2.56  log10 and a 50% effective concentration  (EC50) of 82 
ng/mL [29]. Like other integrase inhibitors, the efficacy of 
cabotegravir relates to Ctrough [30].
3.2  Dosing Recommendations
Cabotegravir is prescribed as an oral lead-in phase of 30 
mg daily for at least 28 days to ensure tolerability, followed 
by an intramuscular loading dose of 600 mg, before admin-
istration can continue 4 weeks later at a maintenance dose 
of 400 mg once monthly. If dosing once every 2 months, 
a second 600 mg loading dose should be administered 4 
weeks after the first dose before treatment can proceed at a 
maintenance dose of 600 mg every 8 weeks [31]. Delays and 
treatment interruptions have been evaluated in a population 
pharmacokinetic model, which has informed dosing recom-
mendations [32]. Doses can be administered between 7 days 
before and 7 days after the monthly dose is due. If a monthly 
injection is missed by ≤ 2 months, then continuation of 400 
mg every 4 weeks may continue; however, if the injection is 
missed by more than 2 months, another 600 mg loading dose 
must be administered before proceeding onto 400 mg every 
4 weeks. Likewise, if an 8-weekly injection is missed by ≤ 2 Fig. 1  Mechanisms of drug–
drug interaction after oral 
versus intramuscular admin-
istration of cabotegravir and 
rilpivirine
838 D. Hodge et al.
months, treatment can be re-initialized as normal; however, 
if it is missed by > 2 months, a 600 mg dose must be admin -
istered as soon as possible, followed by a second dose after 
4 weeks, before treatment may continue as normal. In cases 
where patients know they will miss a dose by 7 days, they 
can take oral therapy of 30 mg once daily to replace up to 
two once-monthly or one once every 2 months visits [31].
3.3  Pharmacokinetics
3.3.1  Absorption
A summary of the key pharmacokinetic parameters is pre-
sented in Table  1. As described in the previous section, the 
rate of absorption is a key difference between oral and intra-
muscular administration. Oral cabotegravir has a median 
time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax) of 3 h, to be 
contrasted with that of 7 days for intramuscular administra-
tion [13]. Steady-state concentrations after intramuscular 
administration of cabotegravir are achieved after 44 weeks, much earlier than for rilpivirine (80% steady-state after 48 
weeks) [17]. This difference may need to be accounted for 
when performing pharmacological studies (e.g. tissue phar -
macology). The absolute bioavailability of oral cabotegravir 
has not been studied, however administering oral cabotegra -
vir with a high-fat meal did not have a clinically significant 
effect on cabotegravir pharmacokinetics, thus cabotegravir 
can be administered regardless of food [33]. Cabotegravir is 
a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resist-
ance protein (BCRP), but owing to high passive permeabil-
ity, inhibitors of these intestinal transporters are unlikely to 
affect cabotegravir intestinal absorption [34].
3.3.2  Distribution
Cabotegravir is highly protein-bound (> 99.8 %) and the 
blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.5. The volume of distribution fol-
lowing oral cabotegravir is 12.3 L [13, 31]. Of interest, the 
distribution of cabotegravir in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
was measured in HIV-infected individuals 7 days after the 
Table 1  Key pharmacokinetic parameters of cabotegravir and rilpivirine administered either orally or intramuscularly [13, 17, 31, 34, 37, 46,

virine 600 mg administered every 4 weeks (n  = 3) or cabo-
tegravir 600 mg + rilpivirine 900 mg administered every 
8 weeks (n  = 15) [35]. Median total cabotegravir CSF was 
11 ng/mL (when administered every 4 weeks) and 13 ng/
mL (when administered every 8 weeks), representing CSF/
plasma ratios of 0.30% and 0.34%, respectively. CSF cabo-
tegravir concentrations exceeded the in vitro  EC50 for wild-
type HIV (i.e. 0.10 ng/mL) and all patients maintained CSF 
viral RNA below 50 copies/mL This study demonstrates that 
therapeutic concentrations of cabotegravir can be achieved 
in the CSF following intramuscular administration.
3.3.3  Metabolism and Elimination
The main route of cabotegravir clearance is hepatic metabo-
lism. A mass balance study of oral cabotegravir determined 
the main metabolite is a glucuronic acid conjugate (M1), 
which is excreted in the urine along with a minor metabolite, 
a glucose conjugate (M2). A small amount of unchanged 
cabotegravir is excreted via bile/faeces. There are no mass 
balance data for intramuscular cabotegravir, as the long t½ 
makes sample collection impractical. However, post hoc 
analysis of urine samples from a phase I trial has revealed 
that M1 accounted for > 90% of the drug-related material 
recovered, irrespective of route of administration (in this 
case, either subcutaneous or intramuscular). Thus, it is likely 
that hepatic clearance of cabotegravir is identical for both 
oral and intramuscular administration. In vitro analysis has 
revealed the primary hepatic enzyme responsible for cabo-
tegravir metabolism is UGT1A1, with some additional con-
tribution from UGT1A9 [ 36]. Cabotegravir does not inhibit 
or induce cytochromes (CYP) or glucuronidation enzymes. 
In vitro studies have also indicated that cabotegravir does 
not inhibit the transporters P-gp, BCRP, multidrug resistance 
protein (MRP) 2, MRP4, organic anion transporting poly -
peptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter 
(OCT) 1, OCT2, bile salt export pump (BSEP), or the renal 
multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1 and 
MATE2K at clinically relevant concentrations. On the other 
hand, cabotegravir inhibits the renal transporters OAT1 (half 
maximal inhibitory concentration  [IC50] = 0.81 µM) and 
OAT3  (IC50 = 0.41 µM) [34]. Physiologically based pharma-
cokinetic (PBPK) studies showed a mean increase in OAT1 
or OAT3 substrate (i.e. ciprofloxacin, tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate, cidofovir, methotrexate, adefovir, oseltamivir and 
cefuroxime) exposure of < 25% with concomitant adminis-
tration of oral cabotegravir [37]. PBPK modelling suggests 
that OAT1/OAT3 inhibition is not clinically relevant, how -
ever the European product label [31] recommends caution 
when coadministering with a narrow therapeutic index drug 
such as methotrexate.Plasma concentration is a key consideration for an antiret-
roviral, be it for ART or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). 
Concentrations must be sufficient to not only prevent viro-
logic failure (in ART) or de novo infection (PrEP) but also 
to guard against selecting for resistant HIV strains, as may 
occur when drug concentrations fall below the therapeutic 
range [38]. The long pharmacokinetic ‘tail’ of intramuscular 
cabotegravir, as driven by its greater t½ (see Table  1), may 
give rise to increased risk of HIV resistance after cessa-
tion of treatment. The ECLAIR2 reported an intramuscu-
lar cabotegravir t½ of 40 days (after multiple cabotegravir 
doses) in cisgender men. Seventeen percent of men had 
detectable cabotegravir after 52 weeks [16]. In a follow-up 
of the HPTN 077 trial, which studied intramuscular cabo-
tegravir as PrEP in both men and women, showed that 78% 
of those assigned male at birth had undetectable cabotegra-
vir 52 weeks after the final injection, as opposed to 37% of 
those assigned female at birth. Males had a t½ of 43.5 days 
compared with 60.4 days in females, an increase of 33%. 
These factors may need to be taken into consideration when 
addressing the potential for DDIs during a pharmacokinetic 
tail [15].
3.4  Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
3.4.1  Renal Impairment
A phase I trial compared the pharmacokinetics of oral 
cabotegravir between healthy volunteers and patients with 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). As is 
expected for a drug mainly metabolized by the liver, renal 
impairment did not affect cabotegravir Cmax, AUC, or t½. 
Dialysis is also unlikely to affect cabotegravir clearance 
as it is highly protein-bound [39]. The product monograph 
states that cabotegravir may be administered without dose 
adjustment in patients with mild–moderate renal impairment 
but advises monitoring for adverse events in patients with 
severe kidney impairment, end-stage kidney disease, or on 
dialysis [13].
3.4.2  Hepatic Impairment
The pharmacokinetics of oral cabotegravir was studied in 
another phase I trial comparing healthy volunteers with 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child–Pugh 
7-9). As cabotegravir is highly protein-bound (> 99.8%), 
particularly to albumin, hepatic impairment was expected 
to increase free plasma cabotegravir due to the associated 
decrease in the production of albumin. Indeed, unbound 
cabotegravir was 40% and 50% higher in hepatic insuffi-
ciency 2 and 24 h post-dose, respectively. This resulted in 
an increase in cabotegravir clearance in patients with moder -
ate hepatic impairment, as signified by a decrease in AUC, 840 D. Hodge et al.
Cmax and Ctrough of 27%, 31% and 27%, respectively. Neither 
the increase in free cabotegravir nor the increase in clear -
ance seen in moderate hepatic impairment is clinically sig-
nificant, given the wide therapeutic window of cabotegravir 
[40]. However, it should be noted that a 30% reduction in 
cabotegravir AUC could be relevant in patients receiving 
moderate inducers, or with high BMI or polymorphisms/
resistance-associated mutations in the HIV integrase gene. 
The product monograph advises that cabotegravir may be 
administered without dose adjustment in mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment but warns that administration in severe 
hepatic impairment (Child–Pugh score C) has not been stud-
ied [13, 31].
3.4.3  Pregnancy
The Cabenuva product monograph states that cabotegra -
vir has not been studied in pregnant women and therefore 
the associated risks, including neural tube defects, cannot 
be assessed [13]; however, 13 pregnancies were recorded 
during the HPTN077 trial, of which four were carried to 
term. Cabotegravir was discontinued after the discovery of 
pregnancy, but detectable levels of cabotegravir persisted 
throughout pregnancy. No birth defects occurred [41]. Cur -
rently, advice remains to not administer cabotegravir during 
pregnancy unless potential benefits to the patient outweigh 
the potential risks to the fetus [31].
3.5  Rilpivirine
3.5.1  Pharmacodynamics
Rilpivirine is a second-generation diarylpyrimidine NNRTI 
that binds to a hydrophobic pocket close to the active site 
of reverse transcriptase, causing conformational changes 
that inhibit the transcription of viral RNA to DNA [42]. 
When administered as monotherapy to treatment-naïve 
HIV-positive patients, 25–150 mg oral rilpivirine once daily 
decreased mean viral load by 1.2  log10 copies/mL over 7 
days, without giving rise to any resistance mutations [43]. 
Pharmacodynamic analysis of both naïve and pretreated HIV 
patients estimated an  EC50 of 65 ng/mL for 25 mg oral rilpi-
virine once daily (taken with 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate and 200 mg emtricitabine) [44].
3.6  Dosing Recommendations
As with cabotegravir, an oral lead-in phase of 25 mg rilpiv -
irine daily for at least 28 days is administered to ensure tol-
erability. This is followed by an intramuscular loading dose 
of 900 mg, before administration can continue 4 weeks later 
at a maintenance dose of 600 mg once monthly. If dosing 
once every 2 months, a second 900 mg loading dose should be administered 4 weeks after the first dose, before treat -
ment can proceed at a maintenance dose of 900 mg every 
8 weeks. Population pharmacokinetic modelling has vali-
dated a similar oral bridging and re-initialization schedule 
as described for cabotegravir [45]. Rilpivirine injections are 
administered at the same time as cabotegravir injections (but 
into opposite-side gluteal muscles), and, likewise, doses can 
be administered between 7 days before and 7 days after the 
monthly dose is due. If a monthly injection is missed by ≤ 2 
months, then continuation of 600 mg every 4 weeks may 
continue if the injection is administered as soon as possible. 
Again, if the injection is missed by more than 2 months, 
another 900 mg loading dose must be administered before 
proceeding onto 600 mg every 4 weeks. If an 8-weekly injec -
tion is missed by ≤ 2 months, treatment can be re-initialized 
as normal; however, if it is missed by more than 2 months, a 
900 mg dose must be administered as soon as possible, again 
with a second 900 mg dose after 4 weeks, before treatment 
may continue as normal. In cases where patients know they 
will miss a dose by 7 days, they can take oral therapy of 25 
mg once daily to replace up to two once-monthly or one once 
every 2 months visits [46].
3.7  Pharmacokinetics
3.7.1  Absorption
The key pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in 
Table  1. As with intramuscular administration of cabote-
gravir, the long-acting formation of rilpivirine displays flip-
flop pharmacokinetics, with the absorption rate driving the 
t½ of intramuscular rilpivirine. Oral rilpivirine Tmax is 4 h, 
as opposed to 3–4 days for intramuscular rilpivirine, result-
ing in t½ of 45 h for oral rilpivirine and 13–28 weeks for 
intramuscular rilpivirine [13, 47]. Of note, rilpivirine half-
life after oral administration has been shown to be lower in 
real-world cohorts compared with phase III trials (25 vs. 
45 h) [48]. The absolute bioavailability of oral rilpivirine 
has not been studied. The effect of a high-fat meal increased 
the AUC of oral rilpivirine by approximately 45%, whereas 
administration with a high-protein drink decreased the AUC 
of oral rilpivirine by 50%, compared with administration 
with a solid meal. The product monograph therefore advises 
that rilpivirine must be taken with a meal [46]. Moreover, 
the bioavailability of oral rilpivirine is pH-dependent; coad-
ministration with 20 mg omeprazole once daily decreased 
rilpivirine AUC by 40% (when rilpivirine was administered 
at a supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg) [49].
3.7.2  Distribution
Rilpivirine is also highly protein-bound (99.7%), primar -
ily to albumin. The blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.7 [13]. The 841
PK and DDI with LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine
distribution of rilpivirine in the CSF was measured in HIV-
infected individuals treated with a maintenance dose of 
intramuscular cabotegravir + rilpivirine administered every 
4 or 8 weeks [35]. Median total rilpivirine CSF was 1.84 ng/
mL (when administered every 4 weeks; n  = 3) and 1.67 ng/
mL (when administered every 8 weeks; n  = 15), represent-
ing CSF/plasma ratios of 1.07% and 1.32%, respectively. 
CSF rilpivirine concentrations mostly exceeded the in vitro 
 EC50 for wild-type HIV (i.e. 0.27 ng/mL) and all patients 
maintained CSF viral RNA below 50 copies/mL The CSF-
to-plasma ratio of rilpivirine after intramuscular administra-
tion was comparable with the 1.4% ratio reported after oral 
administration of rilpivirine [50].
3.7.3  Metabolism and Elimination
Rilpivirine elimination occurs primarily via hepatic metabo-
lism and CYP3A4 [ 46]. A mass balance study found that 
85% of the administered oral rilpivirine dose was recovered 
in faeces, of which 26% was unchanged rilpivirine. No one 
major metabolite was identified, rather analysis revealed sev -
eral oxidative metabolites. Only 6% of the dose was recov -
ered in urine [51]. There are no reports of rilpivirine as a 
substrate of transporters, however in vitro analysis revealed 
rilpivirine can inhibit BCRP, P-gp, and OAT1B1/3, although 
this is not considered to be clinically significant [52]. Rilpi-
virine inhibits the renal transporter OCT2 involved in the 
tubular secretion of creatinine, thus leading to a slight 
increase in serum creatinine concentrations in individuals 
with normal renal function [53]. However, inhibition of this 
renal transporter did not alter the exposure of the antidia-
betic metformin, which undergoes active renal elimination 
via OCT2 [46]. Thus, available data seem to indicate that 
rilpivirine has a low potential to cause renal DDIs.
Like long-acting cabotegravir, the long-acting intramus-
cular form of rilpivirine also displays a long pharmacoki-
netic tail. Rilpivirine was still detectable in samples col-
lected 168 days after a single intramuscular injection of 
either 600 or 1200 mg [54]. In a pharmacokinetic study of a 
single dose of long-acting rilpivirine in healthy volunteers, 
rilpivirine was detectable in the last samples taken, 84 days 
after the dose. The elimination half-life was found to be 43, 
39 and 38 days with 300, 600 and 1200 mg dosing, respec-
tively [18]. The long elimination half-life raises the issue of 
drug resistance selection when stopping PrEP. The litera-
ture reports the case of one participant in the long-acting 
rilpivirine PrEP study (SSAT040 trial) who acquired HIV 
infection through unprotected intercourse 41 days following 
the administration of a single 300 mg intramuscular injec-
tion of rilpivirine. High levels of viral replication combined 
with low but detectable rilpivirine levels led to the selection 
of resistant virus [55]. This case highlights the need for a 
safe strategy to discontinue long-acting antiretroviral drugs.3.8  Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
3.8.1  Renal Impairment
Population pharmacokinetic analyses predict that mild renal 
impairment does not affect rilpivirine exposure [13]. Nei-
ther intramuscular nor oral rilpivirine have been studied in 
cases of moderate to severe renal impairment. The Cabenuva 
product monograph advises that no dosage adjustment is 
required in cases of renal impairment, but in patients with 
severe impairment, end-stage kidney disease, or on dialysis, 
increased monitoring is recommended [13].
3.8.2  Hepatic Impairment
The effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on oral 
rilpivirine exposure was studied in HIV negative volun-
teers. Mild impairment (Child–Pugh A) increased rilpivirine 
AUC by 47%, while moderate impairment (Child–Pugh B) 
increased rilpivirine AUC by 5%, compared with healthy 
controls [42]. No dosage adjustment of intramuscular rilpi-
virine is required in mild or moderate hepatic impairment, 
but extra caution is recommended when administering to 
patients with severe hepatic impairment [13].
3.8.3  Pregnancy
As stated in the previous section, long-acting cabotegravir/
rilpivirine has not been studied in pregnant women and is 
therefore not recommended in this population [13]. Fur -
thermore, several studies have shown decreased rilpivirine 
exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy, compared 
with postpartum, although this does not appear to lead to 
viral breakthrough [56– 58].
4  Safety and Efficacy of Long‑Acting 
Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine
The main efficacy endpoints determined by clinical trials are 
listed in Table  2. The phase IIb LATTE trial found that oral 
cabotegravir/rilpivirine was non-inferior to efavirenz plus 
two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcription inhibitors (NRTIs) 
in treatment-naïve HIV-positive patients [59]. LATTE-2 
found that intramuscular cabotegravir/rilpivirine (both every 
4 weeks and every 8 weeks) was non-inferior to oral cabo-
tegravir with abacavir and lamivudine in treatment-naive 
HIV-positive patients [8]. In phase III trials, FLAIR showed 
that switching to intramuscular cabotegravir/rilpivirine was 
non-inferior to oral dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine in 
virally suppressed HIV-positive patients [60]. ATLAS dem-
onstrated that switching to intramuscular cabotegravir/rilpi-
virine was non-inferior in virally suppressed HIV-positive 842 D. Hodge et al.
patients compared with a variety of other treatments, includ-
ing another integrase inhibitor, an NNRTI, a boosted pro-
tease inhibitor or unboosted atazanavir, together with two 
NRTIs [61]. Virologic suppression continued throughout 
the extension phase of ATLAS [ 62]. Furthermore, the phase 
IIIb ATLAS-2M trial demonstrated that long-acting cabo-
tegravir/rilpivirine administered every 8 weeks was non-
inferior to dosing every 4 weeks in virally suppressed HIV-
positive patients [63]. Of interest, the extension phase of 
FLAIR found switching virally suppressed patients directly 
to intramuscular cabotegravir/rilpivirine from dolutegra-
vir/abacavir/lamivudine (n  = 111) was as efficacious as switching after oral lead-in (n  = 121) and safety and toler -
ability were comparable between the two groups [64].
Resistance to cabotegravir has emerged in clinical trials, 
as is the case for other drugs in the integrase inhibitor class 
[30]. In phase III trials, three of four patients who devel-
oped virological failure in FLAIR had integrase inhibitor 
resistance, which reduced cabotegravir susceptibility by a 
factor of 5 [65]. During ATLAS, three patients experienced 
virological failure, one of whom developed the integrase 
inhibitor resistance mutation N155H, which reduced sus-
ceptibility to cabotegravir by a factor of 2.7 [61]. In vitro 
analysis demonstrated that cabotegravir has a higher genetic

PK and DDI with LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine
barrier to resistance than the first-line integrase inhibitor 
elvitegravir; however, it appears cabotegravir may have a 
lower genetic barrier than dolutegravir and bictegravir [66]. 
It is not known how this may manifest clinically, but care 
should be taken to ensure patient adherence to treatment and 
managing the pharmacokinetic tail after cessation of long-
acting dosing [66].
The most common adverse event seen with long-acting 
cabotegravir was injection site reactions, as well as headache 
and pyrexia. Twenty-five percent of injections resulted in an 
injection site reaction, the median duration of which was 3 
days [60]. The following adverse reactions related to the trial 
regimen were seen in the ATLAS trial: injection site reaction 
(64%), pyrexia (4%), nausea (< 1%), diarrhoea (1%), head-
ache (4%), and lipase increase (< 1%) [61]. Injection site 
reactions (most commonly pain, 91%) were also reported in 
the ECLAIR trial, which studied long-acting cabotegravir 
once every 12 weeks as PrEP for healthy men who have sex 
with men [16]. Despite these adverse effects, questionnaires 
about the participants’ experiences revealed they found them 
worthwhile, with many reporting they wished to continue 
with injections when the drug came to the market, and that 
they would recommend the treatment to others. Most partici-
pants experienced no difficulty attending the appointments 
every 12 weekly for dosing and preferred the intramuscu-
lar phase over the oral phase [67]. Patients in ATLAS-2M 
expressed a preference for treatment every 8 weeks over 
treatment every 4 weeks [63].
5  Drug–Drug Interactions (DDIs)
As mentioned previously, cabotegravir and rilpivirine have 
a low potential to cause DDIs as these antiretrovirals do not 
inhibit or induce CYPs, UGTs, or drug transporters to a clin-
ically significant extent. Furthermore, there is no evidence 
that cabotegravir and rilpivirine cause clinically significant 
DDIs via protein displacement. However, oral cabotegra -
vir and rilpivirine can be subject to DDIs at the intestinal 
and hepatic levels. Results from DDI studies between oral 
cabotegravir or rilpivirine and co-medications are summa-
rized in Figs.  2 and 3 . The interaction profiles of oral and 
intramuscular cabotegravir/rilpivirine, considering 725 co-
medications listed in the Liverpool HIV website [68], are 
presented in Fig.  4. Rilpivirine has a higher potential for 
DDIs compared with cabotegravir, which is explained by not 
only their different metabolic pathways but also the fact that 
rilpivirine is associated with a risk of QT interval prolonga-
tion. Supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg and 300 mg oral daily 
rilpivirine resulted in QTc interval differences of 10.7 msec 
(95% upper confidence bound 15.3) and 23.3 msec (28.4), 
respectively [46]. The label recommends using rilpivirine with caution, particularly when combined with drugs with 
a known risk of Torsade de pointes [46]. Conversely, cabo-
tegravir, at a supratherapeutic dose, did not affect cardiac 
repolarization [69].
5.1  Impact of Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine 
on the Pharmacokinetics of Co‑medications
Clinical DDI studies have demonstrated that oral cabotegra -
vir does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the phar -
macokinetics of the CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam. 
The coadministration of midazolam 3 mg once daily with 
cabotegravir 30 mg once daily increased midazolam AUC 
and Cmax by 10% and 9%, respectively [34]. Cabotegravir 
minimally altered the pharmacokinetics of oral contracep-
tives [70] and rilpivirine [71], supporting in vitro findings 
that it is unlikely to impact the pharmacokinetics of other 
drugs via drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporter path-
ways (Fig.  2a).
Similarly, rilpivirine is devoid of inhibitory or inducing 
effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters and 
was therefore shown to minimally impact the pharmacoki -
netics of atorvastatin [72], paracetamol [73], sildenafil [74], 
oral contraceptives [75], omeprazole [49], rifabutin [76], 
cabotegravir [71], dolutegravir [71], lopinavir/ritonavir [77], 
darunavir/ritonavir [78], tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [79], 
tenofovir alafenamide [80], or the hepatitis C drugs grazo-
previr and elbasvir [81] or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir [82] 
(Fig.  3a).
The coadministration of oral rilpivirine 25 mg once 
daily in patients receiving an individualized methadone 
dose (60–150 mg once daily) decreased the AUC of both 
R- and S-methadone by 16%. No a priori dose adjustment 
of methadone is needed, however clinical monitoring is rec-
ommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to 
be adjusted in some patients [83]. Furthermore, caution is 
recommended as both drugs have the potential to prolong 
the QT interval [84].
Altogether, these DDI studies indicate that oral cabote-
gravir and rilpivirine have a low potential to cause phar -
macokinetic interactions, which also holds true when these 
drugs are administered intramuscularly.
5.2  Impact of Co‑medications on Cabotegravir 
and Rilpivirine Pharmacokinetics
The strong inducer rifampicin has been shown to reduce oral 
cabotegravir exposure by 59% [ 85], which may result in loss 
of virologic response, therefore coadministration with strong 
inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbi-
tal, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifapentine, or St John’s Wort) 
is contraindicated (Fig.  2b). Of interest, coadministration 844 D. Hodge et al.
845
PK and DDI with LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine
with the moderate inducer rifabutin was shown to have a 
more modest effect on oral cabotegravir exposure, with a 
decrease in Cmax, AUC and Ctrough  of 17%, 23% and 26%, 
respectively [86]. This reduction is not clinically meaning-
ful and therefore oral cabotegravir can be coadministered 
with moderate inducers. As for other inducers (see Sect.  2), 
rifabutin is expected to cause a similar DDI magnitude with 
both the intramuscular and oral forms of cabotegravir. Thus, 
coadministration with moderate inducers may be possible 
with intramuscular cabotegravir (used alone for HIV preven-
tion), although further data are warranted, particularly in 
special populations. Since moderate inducers significantly 
alter rilpivirine pharmacokinetics, their use is contraindi-
cated with intramuscular cabotegravir when combined with 
intramuscular rilpivirine for the treatment of HIV [68].
The effect of hormonal contraceptive use on intramus-
cular cabotegravir pharmacokinetics (maintenance dose) 
was evaluated in the framework of the HPTN077 study 
[87]. Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) 
[intramuscular cabotegravir plus contraceptive vs. intra-
muscular cabotegravir alone] for cabotegravir Cmax, AUC 
and Ctrough were 0.75 (0.59–0.93), 0.81 (0.65–1.01) and 0.91 
(0.72–1.15), respectively. Although the use of contraceptives 
caused a statistically significant reduction in cabotegravir 
Cmax concentration, no significant differences were observed 
for the other pharmacokinetic parameters, suggesting that 
this DDI is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. However, further studies are needed to fully characterize this interac-
tion, particularly with gender-affirming hormonal therapies 
that use higher doses of estradiol.
As mentioned previously, rilpivirine is more susceptible 
to DDIs as it is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and can 
be impacted by CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (Fig.  3b). 
For instance, the coadministration of oral rilpivirine at a 
dose higher than the licensed dose (i.e. 150 mg once daily) 
and darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) increased 
rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Ctrough by 79%, 130% and 178%, 
respectively [78]. However, given the good tolerability of 
rilpivirine, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can be coadministered 
without the need for a dose adjustment, a recommendation 
that also applies to intramuscular rilpivirine [68].
Conversely, coadministration with the strong CYP3A4 
inducer rifampicin decreased oral rilpivirine Cmax, AUC 
and Ctrough  by 69%, 80% and 89%, respectively [88]. Due 
to the profound reduction in rilpivirine pharmacokinetics, 
rifampicin, along with other potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
anticonvulsants or St John’s wort), is contraindicated with 
both oral and intramuscular rilpivirine. The coadministra-
tion of oral rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) with the moder -
ate CYP3A4 inducer rifabutin (300 mg once daily) reduced 
rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Ctrough  by 31%, 42% and 48%, 
respectively [76]. DDIs with moderate inducers can be man-
aged by increasing the oral rilpivirine dose to 50 mg once 
daily (Fig.  3b). However, there are no recommendations 
on how to manage the DDI with moderate inducers with 
intramuscular administration of rilpivirine and therefore 
moderate inducers are contraindicated with the injectable 
form [68].
Besides moderate inducers, the main differences in the 
DDI profile of oral and intramuscular rilpivirine relate to 
proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers or antacids, which have 
the potential to reduce rilpivirine absorption, whereas this 
DDI is prevented with the intramuscular form. Similarly, 
divalent cations contained in antacids or mineral supple-
ments can reduce the absorption of oral cabotegravir due to 
chelation in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas this DDI is 
avoided with the intramuscular form.
5.3  Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic 
Modelling to Simulate DDIs
Given the long half-life of intramuscular cabotegravir and 
rilpivirine, DDI studies cannot be easily conducted. Going 
forward, it is almost certain that data from oral DDI stud -
ies with cabotegravir and rilpivirine will be used to inform 
PBPK modelling. PBPK modelling is a bottom-up approach Fig. 2  a Impact of oral cabotegravir on co-medication pharmacoki-
netics from drug–drug interaction crossover studies in healthy vol-
unteers. 1. Period 1: Oral midazolam 3 mg daily for 10 days. Period

that predicts drug pharmacokinetics using anatomical, physi-
ological and biological data for the population of interest 
and in vitro data describing the absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and elimination of the drug of interest [89]. 
PBPK modelling enables simulation of clinical scenarios 
and therefore constitutes a useful approach to predict DDIs 
with intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine. Rifampicin 
was shown to reduce the AUC of oral cabotegravir by 59% 
[85] and oral rilpivirine by 80% [ 46]. PBPK models vali -
dated against the observed data for oral cabotegravir, rilpi-
virine and rifampicin predicted a reduction in AUC of 41% 
for intramuscular cabotegravir and 82% for intramuscular 
rilpivirine in the presence of rifampicin for the first mainte-
nance dose of cabotegravir and rilpivirine [25]. Cabotegra-
vir AUC was shown to be more profoundly reduced when 
simulating steady-state conditions. Thus, PBPK modelling 
supports the recommendation that rifampicin or any other strong inducers should also be avoided with intramuscular 
cabotegravir and rilpivirine due to the substantial reduc-
tion in their exposures, which may lead to treatment failure. 
Finally, PBPK models were able to show that the UGT1A1 
inhibitor atazanavir and the UGT1A9 inhibitor mefenamic 
acid have a minimal effect, with 11% and 10% increases, 
respectively, in cabotegravir AUC [90]. This effect does not 
warrant a dose adjustment of cabotegravir in the presence of 
UGT inhibitors. This finding is also supported by the results 
of another study showing that genetic variations character -
ized by a reduced function of UGT1A1 resulted in a modest 
increase in cabotegravir AUC after oral (28–50%) or intra-
muscular (16–24%) administration [91].Fig. 3  a Impact of oral rilpivirine on co-medication pharmacoki-

PK and DDI with LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine
6  Conclusions
The licensing of cabotegravir/rilpivirine as the first-ever 
long-acting regimen for the treatment of HIV in virologically 
supressed patients is an exciting advance for antiretroviral 
therapy. Reduced pill burden coupled with the long time 
between dose administrations (monthly or bimonthly) [92], 
affords PLWH an easy and well-tolerated treatment option. 
The possibility for long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine to 
also be used as PrEP promises new avenues, as adherence 
has been shown to be critical for optimal protection against 
HIV acquisition [93].
The pharmacokinetics of intramuscular administration of 
cabotegravir/rilpivirine are driven by the slow absorption of 
drug from the muscle depot, resulting in elimination half-
lives measured in weeks rather than hours [ 13, 46]. While 
these pharmacokinetics are optimal for long-acting medica -
tion, it is important to consider the long pharmacokinetic 
tail of intramuscular cabotegravir/rilpivirine, which, if the 
patient is not switched to other ARV therapy, could lead to 
emergent treatment-resistant HIV strains.
The intramuscular administration of long-acting cabo-
tegravir/rilpivirine effectively bypasses gut-based drug 
interactions, and the differing DDI profiles between the two 
routes of administration should be taken into account when 
administering these drugs. In particular, DDIs resulting from 
the chelation of cabotegravir by divalent cations in the stom-
ach, or DDIs with rilpivirine due to pH changes, are avoided. 
Likewise, the effect on metabolizing enzymes is restricted 
to liver enzymes only, rather than in the gut. Both the oral 
and intramuscular formulations of cabotegravir and rilpiv -
irine are included in the Liverpool drug interaction website 
(http:// www. hiv- drugi ntera ctions. org), where interactions 
can be checked against more than 700 co-medications. Given 
that DDI studies have only been conducted with the oral 
form of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, this leads to inevita-
ble questions on the relevance and potential management 
of DDIs with the intramuscular form during treatment, fol-
lowing cessation of treatment (i.e. the tail) and in the case 
of missed injection visits. Furthermore, differences in the 
pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration have 
been observed in individuals with a high BMI or in females, during clinical trials. The clinical relevance of certain DDIs 
(notably moderate inducers administered with cabotegravir 
used as PrEP) have not been evaluated in these special popu-
lations. Other gaps relate to the effect of variation in the 
injection site or injection methods.
