During new drug development, clinical drug interaction studies are carried out in accordance with the
mechanism of potential drug interactions evaluated by in vitro studies. The obtained information should
be provided ef ﬁciently to medical experts through package inserts and various information materials
after the drug's launch. A recently updated Japanese guideline presents general procedures that areconsidered scienti ﬁcally valid at the present moment. In this review, we aim to highlight the viewpoints
of the Japanese guideline and enumerate drugs that were involved or are anticipated to be involved in
evident pharmacokinetic drug interactions and classify them by their clearance pathway and potential
intensity based on systematic reviews of the literature. The classi ﬁcation would be informative for
designing clinical studies during the development stage, and the appropriate management of drug in-
teractions in clinical practice.

1. Introduction
In current drug therapy where two or more drugs are routinely
coprescribed, physicians and pharmacists need to pay utmost
attention to avoid drug interactions (DIs) that may lead to un-
pleasant adverse events and insuf ﬁcient drug effects [ 1]. In this
review, DIs include interactions between drug and drug as well as
between drug and food/beverage. In the past, some effective drugs
unfortunately caused serious adverse events due to unexpected DIs
and were withdrawn from the market [ 2] such as the concomitantuse of sorivudine and ﬂuorouracil-based anticancer drugs [ 3]. In
recent decades, the mechanism of pharmacokinetic DIs has been
elucidated very well due to advances in pharmacokinetic research,
which allows the prediction of the degree of DI for many combi-
nations of drugs [ 4,5]. By referring to the latest information, the risk
of DI is becoming routinely minimized during the screening pro-
cess; nevertheless, if the potential of a DI is detected during the
drug-development process, the information should be appropri-
ately conveyed to physicians and pharmacists.
In Japan, the Guideline on Drug Interaction for Drug Development
and Appropriate Provision of Information (Japanese guideline) was
notiﬁed in 2018 by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [ 6].
The guideline was implemented through the public consultations
as a formal procedure in Japan and by soliciting comments from the
regulatory authorities of the United States and Europe. It re ﬂects
the latest scienti ﬁc knowledge and presents the appropriate*Corresponding author.

drugs and how the risks and information of DIs should be provided
to medical experts. The Japanese guideline includes lists of sub-
strates, inhibitors, and inducers of cytochrome P450s (P450s) and
transporters, which would be used as index drugs or typical drugs
at various steps of DI evaluation in the drug-development process.
In this review, we aim to enumerate drugs that were involved or are
anticipated to be involved in evident pharmacokinetic DIs and
classify them by their clearance pathway and potential intensity
from more general viewpoints based on systematic reviews of the
literature and similar classi ﬁcations [ 7,8]. The lists are restricted to
clinically prevalent drugs in Japan, in most cases, which are infor-
mative for designing clinical studies during drug development and
the appropriate management of DIs in clinical practice.
According to Japanese regulations on package inserts of drugs
[9], clinical alerts regarding DIs are classi ﬁed into “contraindication
for co-administration (do not co-administer) ”or“precaution for co-
administration (be careful about concomitant use) ”. All drug names
that are contraindicated have to be described by their nonpropri-
etary names and representative brand names in the package insert.
Alerts regarding DIs classi ﬁed as “precaution for co-administration ”
are requested that nonproprietary names or names of drug class are
listed in the package insert. For alerts regarding DIs classi ﬁed as
“precaution for co-administration ”and metabolized mainly by
CYP3A, the guideline requests that the strength classi ﬁcation of
CYP3A inhibition or induction is also clari ﬁed in the package inserts
so that a more systematic and updated management of DIs can be
performed depending on the therapeutic effect or pharmacokinetic
properties of concomitant drugs. The classi ﬁcations presented in
this review would also be valuable because they provide suggestive
information to determine how the drugs should be used in com-
bination in clinical practice and includes the latest available infor-
mation for medical experts who need systematic knowledge on
index drugs and typical drugs of DIs including the strength classi-
ﬁcation of inhibitors and inducers for P450.
2. Pharmacokinetic theory and limitations to be considered
The signi ﬁcance of DIs was understood even at the dawn of drug
metabolism research when P450 was discovered and found to be
inducible [ 10,11]. Then, DIs associated with changes in blood drug
concentrations were reported for many cases, but reasonable pre-
dictions of DIs were achieved only after isoenzymes of human P450
were identi ﬁed in the 1980s [ 12], together with the development of
the clearance theory and physiologically based pharmacokinetic
(PBPK) analysis [ 13]. The whole-body clearance, which means the
performance of drug elimination from the body is evaluated in vivo
by dividing the dose by the drug blood concentration area under
the curve (AUC) after systemic administration. The whole-body
clearance is also equal to the sum of organ clearances, and to
calculate organ clearance from intrinsic clearance, which is
measurable by in vitro experiments, a local organ model, such as the
well-stirred model, is necessary to consider the in ﬂuence of the
blood ﬂow passing through. When a drug is administered orally,
the oral clearance becomes proportional to the hepatic intrinsic
clearance without being affected by the blood ﬂow due to a
contribution of the ﬁrst-pass effect. Thus, the theory suggests that
AUC changes of orally administered drugs caused by pharmacoki-
netic DIs are inversely proportional to changes in the hepatic
intrinsic clearance in principle. PBPK analysis would be useful when
this simple assumption needs to be adjusted due to more compli-
cated situations.
An inhibitor with a similar strength of inhibitory effect to a
speci ﬁc enzyme of P450 is theoretically expected to change the AUC
of a substrate with high speci ﬁcity for the enzyme to a similarextent, regardless of whether the inhibition is reversible (including
competitive) or irreversible (time-dependent). Thus, the classi ﬁ-
cation of inhibitors by the degree of change in the AUC of a
particular sensitive substrate is useful to estimate pharmacokinetic
DIs with various similar substrates. The substrate used to classify
inhibitors should be selective for the pathway of the metabolism to
be evaluated. The Japanese guideline de ﬁned a substrate showing a
5-fold or greater AUC change in combination with a strong inhibitor
as a “sensitive substrate, ”which means that at least 80% of the oral
clearance depends on the route. Similarly, a substrate that exhibits
an AUC change from double to 5-fold is de ﬁned as a “moderately
sensitive substrate, ”which corresponds to 50 e80% dependence.
Inhibitors of representative P450s were classi ﬁed as strong, mod-
erate, or weak depending on the degree of AUC changes of the
sensitive substrate in the Japanese guideline on DIs, and these
classi ﬁcations correspond to AUC changes of /C215-fold, /C212t o<5-
fold, and <2-fold respectively. In this review, however, weak in-
hibitors are not described from the viewpoint of clinical interaction
management because both the degree of AUC change and the
selectivity are sometimes unclear. The classi ﬁcations and certain
terms related to substrate, inhibitor and inducer are described inthe Glossary at the end of this manuscript.
The above theory could also be applied to some of the hepatic
clearance regulated by transporters, but there are a few points to
consider. In the case of a drug that is taken up into the liver via an
uptake transporter such as organic anion transporting polypeptide
(OATP) 1B, and does not return to the bloodstream at all, the theory
can be applied correctly. However, this may be an exceptional case.
For most of the substrates of hepatic uptake transporters, hepatic
clearance is estimated as a complex function of passive and active
uptake, vascular ef ﬂux, biliary ef ﬂux, and metabolism. Further-
more, transporters are also often expressed in the extrahepatic
tissues. As will be described in the “Drugs involved in pharmaco-
kinetic DIs mediated by transporters ”section 4, overlapping sub-
strate recognition is an additional issue for the prediction of
transporter-mediated pharmacokinetic DIs. Overall, for drugs
involved in transporter-mediated DIs, the change in AUC often does
not correspond to the intrinsic transporter activity of a particular
transporter at a particular location. For this reason, drugs involved
in DIs mediated by transporters are classi
ﬁed not by the degree of
DI but by transporters in this review.
The mechanism of DIs found in clinical settings can be even
more complicated than those assumed in the above theory. In the
small intestine, metabolism by CYP3A and ef ﬂux transport by P-
glycoprotein (P-gp) are often simultaneously involved in DIs. In the
Japanese guideline, a formula for estimating the risk of DIs in the
small intestine from in vitro experiments is described, but this was
derived empirically from the relationship between the intensity of
thein vitro and in vivo DIs and does not provide a pharmacokinetic
estimate of the drug concentration in the intestinal epithelial cells
where the interaction is occurring. Even for advanced models
currently used in PBPK analysis, the predictability of DIs in the
small intestine has hardly been veri ﬁed yet because we do not
know the precise drug concentrations in the enterocytes and the
activity of ef ﬂux transporters including P-gp and breast cancer
resistance protein (BCRP). At present, for drugs that have aremarkably high metabolic clearance by CYP3A and/or for those
transported by P-gp or BCRP extensively, caution should be taken to
avoid a higher risk of DI due to the contribution by the small
intestine.
The theory of DIs caused by a change in hepatic clearance cannot
be applied to drugs that are to be cleared extensively from the
extrahepatic tissue. For a representative example, renal clearance is
composed of three processes, namely, glomerular ﬁltration, tubular
secretion, and reabsorption, and in the case of interaction involvingK. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414
2transporter activity in the processes of secretion and reabsorption,
the basic equation differs depending on whether the transporter is
located at the basolateral or apical side. In these cases, the most
probable prediction would be obtained from a careful analysis us-
ing the PBPK model. The degree of DIs is smaller after intravenous,
intramuscular, or transdermal administrations of the substrate than
that after oral administration, in general due to a lack of the ﬁrst-
pass effect. An analysis by a PBPK model would again be consid-
ered effective in these cases.
In this review, drugs were classi ﬁed based on the largest change
in the index parameter observed in their DI studies, as described in
the next section. Furthermore, all the classi ﬁcation is based on the
average parameter changes observed in clinical studies in primarily
healthy subjects. The potential for interstudy and interindividual
differences needs to be considered to apply the classi ﬁcation of
drugs from this review to a clinical setting. In the pediatric popu-
lation, especially in those below the age of two years, the devel-
opment of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters is
insufﬁcient [ 14]. In the elderly population, renal and hepatic
functions are considerably reduced [ 15]. Furthermore, pharmaco-
kinetics and DIs are affected by various disease states [ 16,17].
Because of these variations, DIs can be enhanced potentially by
several times. Overall, these uncertainties and exceptions need to
be considered carefully when the classi ﬁcation presented in this
review is to be applied to clinical practice.
3. Drugs involved in evident pharmacokinetic DIs mediated
by P450s
Substrates, inhibitors, and inducers of P450 involved in evident
pharmacokinetic DIs were classi ﬁed according to AUCR (the ratio of
AUC in the presence of an interacting drug to that in the absence)
after oral doses or the ratio of oral clearance (CL/F) in most cases,
which is observed in a clinical DI study with one of the designated
in vivo index drugs of P450 according to the Japanese guideline. In a
few cases, trough and steady-state concentrations were used as
described in the table. The guidance issued in 2020 by the United
States FDA are also referred to as a regulatory document that de-
ﬁnes the same strength classi ﬁcation of P450 inhibition or induc-
tion (strong, moderate, or weak inhibitor or inducer).
For examining the drug list, the new drug approval information
of Japan (March 31, 2020. http://www.pmda.go.jp/PmdaSearch/
iyakuSearch/ ) and the United States ( https://www.accessdata.fda.
gov/scripts/cder/daf/ ), Drug Interaction Solutions ’PK-based Drug
Interaction Database (DIDB) ( http://www.druginteractioninfo.org ),
and the UCSF-FDA Transportal ( http://bts.ucsf.edu/fdatransportal/ )
were used. Drugs to be considered for each decision tree of the
drug-metabolizing enzyme P450 in the Japanese guideline were
extracted and classi ﬁed based on changes in pharmacokinetics in
clinical DI studies.
We extracted drugs that could cause interactions accompanied
by remarkable (strong) to moderate changes in pharmacokinetics,
which are particularly important from the viewpoint of clinical
interaction management, and classi ﬁed drugs with the application
of Japanese clinical settings as represented in Tables 1 e3. Therefore,
the tables exclude drugs that are currently not marketed in Japan,
but include clinical index drugs shown in the Japanese guideline.
InTable 3 , inducer drugs are listed by each isozyme of P450
because inductions were examined by clinical studies in which an
isozyme-selective substrate drug was co-administered. However,
inducers are described together at the end of this chapter since
several P450 isozymes are frequently induced together.3.1. Substrates and inhibitors of P450
3.1.1. Substrates and inhibitors of CYP1A2
It has been demonstrated that the AUC of sensitive CYP1A2
substrates notably increased when administered with ﬂuvoxamine
(caffeine 13.7-fold, tizanidine 32.7-fold, and ramelteon 128-fold).
These evident DIs need to be avoided carefully in clinical settings. It
is well-known that ﬂuvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2 as well as
CYP2C19. Furthermore, it also inhibits CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and
CYP3A4 in vitro [18]. Although the degrees of inhibition of ﬂuvox-
amine against some of these enzymes in vivo are obscure, the
observed strong DIs might be related to its broad inhibition spec-
iﬁcity for various P450s. For this reason, although ﬂuvoxamine is
selected as the index inhibitor of CYP1A2 in the Japanese guideline,
the results of a clinical DI study need to be interpreted carefully for
the possible contribution of the other P450 enzymes.
3.1.2. Substrates and inhibitors of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8
In the cases of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, the number of substrates
and inhibitors listed in Tables 1 and 2 are relatively small. However,
it should be noted that the frequency of pharmacokinetic DIs would
be potentially more than those implied by the list because in vitro
studies have not been carried out routinely for these enzymes until
recently, and thus, only limited clinical DI studies have been per-
formed. Although a very strong inhibition of CYP2B6 was observedin vitro for some azoles [ 19,20], no clinical study has been per-
formed to con ﬁrm their in vivo signiﬁcance.
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent of cancer activated by
CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 [ 21]. Therefore, the outcome of cyclophos-
phamide treatment might be affected by DIs as well as the genetic
polymorphism with regard to both enzymes [ 22], although it is not
included in Table 1 . Bupropion designated as a sensitive clinical
substrate of CYP2B6 is not marketed in Japan, thus not included in
Table 1 . To evaluate CYP2B6-dependent clearance, stereoselective
metabolism of bupropion may need to be evaluated [ 23].
It should be recognized that cerivastatin, an effective HMG-CoA
inhibitor, was withdrawn from the market because of severe DI by
gemﬁbrozil. Cerivastatin is a substrate of CYP2C8, and in this
evident and fatal DI, it has been reported that glucuronide of
gemﬁbrozil played a critical role in the irreversible inhibition of
CYP2C8 [ 24,25].
3.1.3. Substrates and inhibitors of CYP2C9
Warfarin is the in vivo index substrate of CYP2C9, but it should
be noted that warfarin is composed of two optical isomers, the S-
isomer and R-isomer; the S-isomer is more effective and shows
higher selectivity for CYP2C9 than the R-isomer [ 26]. Therefore,
when warfarin is to be used in clinical DI studies, changes in both
drug concentrations and ef
ﬁcacy should be observed. In Table 1 ,S -
warfarin is described, considering the evaluation of DI potentials in
clinical studies. Recently, miconazole, known as an inhibitor of
CYP3A, was contraindicated for use with warfarin in Japan [ 27]
because it also strongly inhibited CYP2C9 and caused severe DI in
association with warfarin. Some azole antifungals, including mi-
conazole, often inhibit multiple P450 isoenzymes in vitro , but it
should be kept in mind that their in vivo inhibition potential has not
been veri ﬁed satisfactorily. In the future, further accumulation of
information is necessary. Celecoxib is designated as a sensitive
clinical substrate of CYP2C9 in the United States, considering the
results of pharmacogenetic studies [ 28].
Although not listed in Table 2 , it has been suggested that blood
concentrations of losartan, warfarin, and phenytoin were increasedK. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414

which may include TS-1, UFT, tegafur, ﬂuorouracil, doxi ﬂuridine,
capecitabine, and carmofur [ 29,30]. They are not mentioned in the
list because ﬂuorouracil does not directly inhibit CYP2C9 in vitro
[31]. It was surmised that ﬂuorouracil decreases the expression of
CYP2C9 in the liver by some unknown mechanism [ 32]. Similar
interaction by ﬂuorouracil has also been suggested for CYP2C19[33]. Therefore, it is recommended to regard ﬂuorouracils as if they
are strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 for proper clinical
management of DIs.

Other elimination pathways may also contribute to the elimination of the substrates listed and should be considered when assessing the drug interact ion potential. Some
drugs not on the list may also be considered when assessing the drug interaction potential. (e.g. cyclophosphamide is mainly activated by CYP2B6, the refore inhibition of
CYP2B6 may result in in vivo drug interaction. Clopidogrel is mainly activated by CYP2C19, therefore, inhibition of CYP2C19 in addition to its polymorphism affects the effect) .

aClassi ﬁcation is in principle based on the largest observed AUC change (worst case scenario) in the study with a clinical index inhibitor. Sensitive: AUC incr ease by /C215-fold
(CL/F decrease to <1/5) when co-administered with a strong inhibitor. Moderately sensitive: AUC increase by /C212-fold but <5-fold (CL/F decrease to <1/2 but /C211/5) when co-
administered with a strong inhibitor.

7inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A, and ﬂuconazole is also an inhibitor
of CYP2C9 and CYP3A. The results of clinical trials that use these
drugs as inhibitors need to be interpreted carefully considering the
clearance pathway of the substrate concomitantly used. Regarding
the clearance by CYP2C19, individual variability due to genetic
polymorphism needs to be carefully considered in Asians, including
the Japanese. Although it is not included in the list as a substrate of
CYP2C19, clopidogrel is a prodrug and CYP2C19 is involved in the
production of the active form of clopidogrel. Therefore, the thera-
peutic bene ﬁt of clopidogrel is dependent on both polymorphism
and the DI relating to CYP2C19 [ 34]. In the antiplatelet treatment
using clopidogrel, concomitant use of omeprazole is often avoided
because omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19 to some extent [ 35],
although the inhibition is not evident as listed in Tables 1 and 2 .
Genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 needs to be considered more
seriously in Japanese people, because it is known that nearly 20% of
Japanese people completely lack the activity of CYP2C19 [ 36].
DIs in patients with a genetic variant of a drug-metabolizing
enzyme may critically differ from those in usual patients with the
wild genotype. For example, in patients lacking CYP2C19 activity, it
is apparent that no DI appears even when an inhibitor of CYP2C19 isused in combination. In contrast, a far more evident DI might
appear when an inhibitor of the other P450s is used in these pa-
tients. Etizolam is a drug that is metabolized by CYP2C19 and
CYP3A4. When a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 is given in combination
with extensive metabolizers (EMs) of CYP2C19, the AUC of etizolam
is raised by barely less than double [ 37], but when the same in-
hibitor is given to poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2C19, it has been
reported that the AUC of etizolam increased to approximately 6-
fold compared with the AUC in EMs without the concomitant
drug [ 38]. In the case of a drug having a signi ﬁcant metabolic
contribution by polymorphic P450 enzymes, individual differences
of DIs may need to be considered.
3.1.5. Substrates and inhibitors of CYP2D6
In contrast to CYP2C19, it is often considered that individual
differences in clearance of CYP2D6 is less in Asians than in West-
erners, because the frequency of PM of CYP2D6 is very small in
Asians. However, it has been demonstrated that the CYP2D6 *10
mutation in Asians is almost as abundant as the wild type, and the
CYP2D6 clearance is greatly diminished in this mutation [ 39,40].
The homozygotes or heterozygotes of CYP2D6 *10are often classi-
ﬁed as intermediate metabolizers (IMs), but this classi ﬁcation is
inconsistent among clinical studies. Special consideration would be
necessary for Asians for individual differences in clearance and DI
to be noticed, not only for drugs metabolized majorly by CYP2C19,
but also those metabolized by CYP2D6.
Eliglustat tartrate, a drug for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher
disease, is a typical example that needs such consideration [ 41]. The
prevalence of Gaucher disease is extremely low, approximately one
in 50,000 to 100,000 people globally. The AUC of eliglustat in PM of
CYP2D6 was 11.2-fold of EM according to the product labeling, so
the contribution of CYP2D6 to the metabolism of this drug is clear.In EM of CYP2D6, the AUC of eliglustat was increased 10-fold when
co-administered with paroxetine, as shown in Table 1 . Because the
approved dosage and DI management of eliglustat vary by the ge-
notype of CYP2D6 in Japan as well as in the United States and
Europe [ 42], its use requires genetic testing for CYP2D6. In EM, it is
contraindicated for use with a combination of both CYP2D6 and
CYP3A inhibitors (moderate or strong), but in IM or PM, it is con-
traindicated simply with a CYP3A inhibitor (moderate or strong).
According to the classi ﬁcation in the clinical trial conducted for this
drug, the homozygote of CYP2D6
*10was classi ﬁed as IM but the
heterozygotes with the wild type were classi ﬁed as EMs.3.1.6. Substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A
As is evident from Tables 1 e3, there are far more substrates,
inhibitors, and inducers that can be involved in DIs mediated by
CYP3A than those by the other P450 enzymes. Because DIs occur
depending on the prescription frequency of both interacting and
affected drugs, many of the pharmacokinetic DIs encountered in
clinical settings would be mediated by CYP3A. Therefore, especially
for CYP3A, it is essential systematically to avoid DIs based on the
classi ﬁcation shown in Tables 1 e3Clinical trials of interactions due
to the inhibition of CYP3A were often conducted with ketoconazole.
However, because ketoconazole is not currently used as an oral
formulation in Japan and the United States FDA does not recom-
mend its use due to safety issues, it is necessary to use other drugs
such as itraconazole in clinical trials. There are several azoles other
than the two mentioned above that strongly inhibit CYP3A, but care
must be taken because P450 isoenzymes other than CYP3A are also
often inhibited strongly by some other azoles. Furthermore, it
should also be considered that because azoles, including ketoco-
nazole and itraconazole, often inhibit P-gp and BCRP as well as
CYP3A, the observed intestinal interactions would not be due to
CYP3A inhibition alone.
Major CYP3A isoenzymes in the adult population are CYP3A4
and CYP3A5 [ 43,44]. In Japan, CYP3A5 is genetically de ﬁcient in
approximately one-third of the population [ 45]. Because the sub-
strate recognition or inhibition selectivity between CYP3A4 and
CYP3A5 often does not differ signi ﬁcantly, it is generally considered
that the individual ﬂuctuations in DI due to polymorphism of
CYP3A5 are not signi ﬁcant. However, because it has been reported
that some substrates are metabolized preferentially by either
CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 [ 46], and some inhibitors demonstrated selec-
tive inhibition of these isoenzymes [ 47], special consideration
might be necessary for these drugs in the future.
CYP3A is expressed in the small intestine as well as in the liver.
Thus, the observed CYP3A-mediated DI is the sum of the contri-
bution by the small intestine and the liver. Drugs that are consid-
erably metabolized in the small intestine are often rapidly
metabolized by CYP3A in vitro [48], and care should be taken to
avoid the risk of signi ﬁcant DIs for those drugs. Vice versa, drugs
that are susceptible to in vivo inhibition of CYP3A with /C2110-fold
increase in the AUC need to be considered for a notable metabolic
contribution by the small intestine [ 49]. Grapefruit juice is the only
beverage listed in Table 2 as a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and its
inhibition is considered to be limited to the small intestine [ 50]. The
DI reports of grapefruit juice vary considerably according to the
amount and frequency of the intake, and the results showing strong
interaction have been obtained on the condition of ingesting a large
amount of dense grapefruit juice, such as double strength [ 51].
Grapefruit juice should be avoided to reduce DI risk, but medical
experts need to know that the risk depends on the amount of
intake.
3.2. Inducers of P450
The induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes occurs by the ac-
tion of nuclear receptors, and pregnane X receptor (PXR), consti-
tutive androstane receptor (CAR), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) are particularly important nuclear receptors, among many, in
the regulation of pharmacokinetics. These nuclear receptors in-
crease the expression of multiple P450 isoenzymes in varied de-
grees; PXR increases expressions of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and
CYP3A, CAR increases those of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and
CYP3A4, and AhR increases the expression of CYP1A2 [ 52,53]. In
addition, one inducer often shows af ﬁnity to multiple nuclear re-
ceptors. Because of these properties, the same drug is often listed as
an inducer of CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP3A, as shown inK. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414
8Table 3 . Furthermore, it is known that PXR also increases the
expression of transporters such as P-gp and multidrug resistance-
associated protein 2 (MRP2), and CAR increases the expression of
other metabolic enzymes such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
(UGT) and sulfotransferase. CYP1A2 is induced via AhR also by
smoking but the inducibility is in ﬂuenced by polymorphisms in
CYP1A2, transcription factors and nuclear receptors [ 54].
In a typical drug-development process, the induction of P450 is
often detected by increased mRNA expressions of CYP1A2, CYP2B6,
and CYP3A in cell-based assays because of the selectivity of nuclear
receptors and detection sensitivity, and this method is also rec-
ommended in the new guideline. For inductions via PXR or CAR, an
increase of CYP3A mRNA is usually detected in this method. The
induction of CYP3A is then evaluated in clinical studies as the next
step, and if the result is positive, the drug might be recognized as an
inducer but only for CYP3A. In this case, medical experts had better
consider the possibility of induction of the related enzymes and
transporters as well as CYP3A. This may also be true for a drug listed
as an inducer of the P450 isoenzymes other than CYP3A in Table 3 .
Currently, inductions of the hepatic enzyme and the intestinal
enzyme are not distinguished clearly in the process of drugdevelopment, and human hepatocytes are primarily used for
in vitro studies [ 55]. However, becauase the expression of nuclear
receptors differs considerably between the liver and small intes-
tine, it might be more relevant to consider an intestine-speci ﬁc
induction in the future. It has been reported that vitamin D re-
ceptor is an important nuclear receptor that regulates the expres-
sion of CYP3A in the intestine [ 56].
4. Drugs involved in pharmacokinetic DIs mediated by
transporters
As with drugs involved in evident pharmacokinetic DIs medi-
ated by P450s, the new drug approval information of Japan (March
31, 2020. http://www.pmda.go.jp/PmdaSearch/iyakuSearch/ ) and
the United States ( https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/
daf/), the drug-interaction database, DIDB ( http://www.
druginteractioninfo.org ), and the UCSF-FDA Transportal ( http://
bts.ucsf.edu/fdatransportal/ ), were used to enumerate drugs
involved in in vitro and in vivo DI mediated by transporters. Changes
in pharmacokinetics were mainly examined with a study con-
ducted by oral administration with AUCR as an indicator. Regarding
the transporter, studies with intravenous administration and
pharmacokinetic parameters other than AUC were also considered
if quantitative information on AUCR was not available in the pre-
vious reports. As a general feature of substrates and inhibitors of
drug transporters, they are often recognized by multiple trans-
porters because of very broad substrate speci ﬁcities for each
transporter that overlap one another. For example, BCRP can
recognize a wide variety of drugs with diverse physicochemical
properties, such as molecular weight (MW) (e.g., urate, MW ¼168
vs. pheophorbide A, MW ¼593) and net charge at neutral pH (7.4)
(e.g., anion [rosuvastatin, etc.], cation [imatinib, etc.], and neutral
[prazosin, etc.]). The same is true for P-gp and MRP2. Such char-acteristics are bene ﬁcial for the ef ﬁcient vectorial transport of drugs
in the intestine, liver, and kidney because multiple uptake and
efﬂux transporters expressed on the opposite side of epithelial cells
can accept the same compound as a substrate. [ 57]. Moreover,
substrate speci ﬁcities of both OATP1B family transporters in the
liver and organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) in the kidney are very
similar (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [statins], angiotensin II
receptor antagonist [sartans]).
Therefore, different from P450 substrates/inhibitors/inducers,
“clinical index drugs ”cannot be clearly de ﬁned for transporter
substrates/inhibitors because of the signi ﬁcant overlapping ofsubstrate recognition among different transporters. Instead, the
current Japanese DI guideline shows examples of “in vivo typical
substrates/inhibitors ”of transporters (Tables 2 e3 and 2 e4 in the
Japanese guideline). They are selected mainly based on clinical
evidence such as outcomes of clinical PK-DI studies with “rela-
tively ”selective substrates/inhibitors or clinical pharmacogenetic
studies for speci ﬁc genetic polymorphisms of a transporter, which
have been known to affect its transport activity as well as accept-
able pharmacokinetic and safety pro ﬁles of drugs. Thus, when the
need for clinical DI studies is considered based on the ﬁnal judge of
decision trees for the evaluation of the possibility of the investi-
gational drug being a substrate/inhibitor of transporters (Figs. 2 e1
to 2e7 in the Japanese guideline), the use of “in vivo typical sub-
strates/inhibitors ”of transporters listed in Tables 2 e3 and 2 e4i n
the Japanese guideline is recommended. Drugs listed in these ta-
bles are selected by multiple criteria. The basic concept of the major
criteria in the Japanese DI guideline is almost the same as that for
the FDA guideline such as in vitro experimental evidence and in vivo
clinical DI outcomes, although the creation of these tables was ﬁrst
initiated independently. However, we also consider multiple factors
such as the approval status and clinical usage of drugs in Japan, andthe rarity of the drugs with a pro ﬁle that selectively inhibits the
transporters. Therefore, some drugs are differently listed in the
Japanese DI guideline and the United States FDA's website. Our
current opinions on these drugs are shown in each subsection.
Because scienti ﬁc knowledge for drug transporters is still being
continuously updated, it should be noted that Tables 2 e3 and 2 e4
never provide exhaustive lists of drugs, and they do not limit the
use of other drugs as substrates/inhibitors for a certain transporter
if reasonable scienti ﬁc evidences are provided. Tables 4 and 5
represent the same sets of drugs that appear in the current Japa-
nese DI guideline (Tables 2 e3 and 2 e4 in the guideline) with
detailed study designs and outcomes (AUCR) of the examples of
representative clinical PK-DI studies, which can support the validity
of studied drugs as in vivo sensitive probes/inhibitors for speci ﬁc
transporters, although they are often recognized by other trans-
porters and metabolizing enzymes. So, we should always take care
to interpret the major cause of transporter-mediated DIs by inte-grating the clinical outcomes with other supportive in vitro and
in vivo evidence for a speci ﬁc combination of interacting and
affected drugs.
4.1. Notes for the selection of in vivo typical substrates of
transporters ( Table 4 )
The United States FDA showed similar types of drug lists on their
website ( https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/
drug-development-and-drug-interactions-table-substrates-
inhibitors-and-inducers#table5-1 ); a part of the substrate drugs for
each transporter is different from those in the Japanese DI guideline
(Table 2-3 in the guideline) because of the difference in the inclu-
sion criteria.
4.1.1. Substrates of P-gp
P-gp can accept a wide variety of structurally diverse com-
pounds regardless of their charge and molecular weight andactively pump them out. P-gp is expressed at the apical side of
various tissues such as the intestine, liver, and kidney, and physi-
ological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-
placental barrier and contributes to the protection of important
sections of the body against exposure to xenobiotics. P-gp works
not only for the suppression of intestinal absorption of orally
administered drugs, but for the enhanced biliary and renal excre-
tion of digoxin and for the decreased brain exposure of drugs such
as ivermectin and cyclosporin A.K. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414

dBecause most of the P-gp substrate is also a substrate of CYP3A and BCRP and these inhibitors can inhibit not only P-gp but CYP3A and BCRP, it should be cau tious that relative contribution of P-gp inhibition to the overall AUC
increase of substrate has not been clari ﬁed.K. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414
11The United States FDA selected the drugs that satis ﬁed the
following criteria: AUCR is /C212 in clinical DI studies with verapamil
or quinidine, in vitro transport by P-gp expression systems has been
conﬁrmed, and drugs are not extensively metabolized. In addition
to these conditions (verapamil (80 mg): [I] g(the expected
maximum concentration [maximum single dose of inhibitors/
250 mL] of the investigational drug in the lumen side of the
gastrointestinal tract) divided by half-maximal inhibitory concen-
tration (IC50) ¼125 [3.14 e11,700], quinidine (200 mg): [I] g/
IC50¼563 [44.0 e12,300] (the geometric mean [range] of [I] g/re-
ported K ior IC50 values for the transport of typical in vitro sub-
strates shown in Table 2 e1 in the Japanese guideline was used)),
cyclosporin A and ketoconazole also have strong inhibition po-
tencies against P-gp in the small intestine in vivo based on the static
model (Fig. 2 e3 in the Japanese guideline) (cyclosporin A (ciclo-
sporin) [200 mg]: [I] g/IC50 ¼442 [108 e2290], ketoconazole
[400 mg]: [I] g/IC50 ¼1690 [475 e7170] (the geometric mean
[range] of [I] g/reported K ior IC50 values for the transport of typical
in vitro substrates shown in Table 2 e1 in the Japanese guideline was
used)). Thus, when the reported AUCR of a substrate drug was /C212i nclinical DI studies with cyclosporin A and ketoconazole, it was
added to Table 2 e3 in the Japanese DI guideline ( Table 4 in this
review).
In the case of topotecan, a previous study indicated that its AUCR
was 1.76 when elacridar (GF120918) was co-administered [ 58].
Elacridar is considered to be a dual potent inhibitor of P-gp and
BCRP (P-gp: [I] g/IC50 ¼106,000 [16,100 e455,000], BCRP: [I] g/
IC50¼8480 [5300 e14,200] at the dose of 1000 mg (the geometric
mean [range] of [I] g/reported K ior IC50 values for the transport of
typical in vitro substrates shown in Table 2 e1 in the Japanese
guideline was used)). Though we cannot conclude the relative
importance of P-gp and BCRP in the clinical DI case with elacridar,
topotecan was included as a potential substrate of P-gp in Table 2 e3
in the Japanese DI guideline ( Table 4 in this review). Cyclosporin A
is also thought to inhibit intestinal BCRP ([I] g/IC50¼99.3, 142 at the
dose of 200 mg ([I] g/reported K ior IC50 values for the transport of
typical in vitro substrates shown in Table 2 e1 in the Japanese DI
guideline was used)). At present, there are few drugs for which the
relative contribution of P-gp and BCRP in the intestine to the sup-
pression of intestinal absorption has been quantitatively identi ﬁed,Table 5

12and we have little knowledge about the inhibition potency of P-gp
inhibitor drugs for BCRP. Thus, we should be careful about the
interpretation of clinical DI outcomes with P-gp inhibitor drugs.
In the interpretation of AUCR values for each P-gp-mediated DI
case, we must pay attention to the evidence in which most of the
drugs (except digoxin, fexofenadine, and dabigatran etexilate) are
metabolized by CYP3A and all of the studied inhibitor drugs can
inhibit CYP3A in the intestine and the liver. Currently, the relative
contribution of CYP3A and P-gp to the overall effect on the AUCR of
affected drugs cannot be clearly separated, and these AUC increases
are thought to be caused by the inhibition of both CYP3A and P-gp.
Digoxin has most often been used as a probe for P-gp in clinical
DI studies because it is mainly excreted into urine without any
extensive metabolism [ 59]. However, the bioavailability of digoxin
is relatively high (about 70%), partly depending on the dosage form,
which means that the small margin of AUC increase is caused only
by the inhibition of intestinal P-gp (maximum AUCR ~ 1.4 ( ¼1/0.7)).
In some DI cases, renal clearance of digoxin was also decreased,
suggesting that the role of P-gp-mediated renal ef ﬂux in the AUC
increased [ 60]. However, a separation of these contributions has
not yet been clearly determined because of the lack of clinicalinformation.
Fexofenadine is a nonmetabolized type of P-gp substrate and its
pharmacological effect is relatively mild (histamine H2 receptor
antagonist) compared with other P-gp probe drugs. Moreover, the
margin of AUC increase caused by intestinal P-gp inhibition is
relatively high (bioavailability ¼33% (product information:
Hoechst Marion, Roussel, Laval, QC, Canada)). However, it is
recognized by multiple uptake and ef ﬂux transporters such as
OATP1Bs, OATP2B1, OAT3, MRP2, MRP3, and MATEs [ 60e64]. Thus,
before clinical DI studies at least, the inhibitory effects of drugs for
the fexofenadine transport, mediated by the above-mentioned
known transporters must be checked in vitro for the accurate pre-
diction of P-gp-mediated DI risks with fexofenadine.
On the other hand, dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that is
metabolized by serum esterase to dabigatran. Previous reports
indicate that dabigatran etexilate is a good substrate of P-gp, but
not dabigatran, and that dabigatran etexilate was con ﬁrmed to be a
nonsubstrate of OATPs, OCTs, OATs, MRP2, and BCRP [ 65]. Because
the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate is about 7%, it enables the
sensitive catch of the inhibition potency of inhibitor drugs on in-
testinal P-gp. However, few clinical DI studies with dabigatran
etexilate have been published, so the further accumulation of
clinical DI examples is needed to compare the DI prediction per-
formance of dabigatran etexilate with that of other P-gp probes.
4.1.2. Substrates of BCRP
Similar to P-gp, BCRP can also ef ﬂux various types of compounds
and it is also expressed in multiple tissues and barriers. Pharma-
cogenetic studies indicated that BCRP contributes to the suppres-
sion of intestinal absorption of various drugs such as sulfasalazine
and rosuvastatin. Moreover, though direct clinical evidence
demonstrating the importance of BCRP in other organs is very
limited at this moment, BCRP plays a role in biliary excretion oftroglitazone sulfate, renal excretion of bile acids and transplacental
transport of glyburide.
There is no BCRP-selective inhibitor among the approved drugs
at the moment. The United States FDA selected the drugs that
satisﬁed the following criteria: AUCR is /C212 with pharmacogenetic
alteration in subjects with ABCG2 c.421C >A and in vitro transport
by BCRP expression systems has been con ﬁrmed. Several in vitro
experiments supported the decreased function of mutated BCRP
with ABCG2 c.421C >A[
66,67]. Because the allele frequency of
c.421C >A is about 32% in the Japanese population, a pharmaco-
genetic study can be designed to understand the impact of thedecrease in BCRP function on the pharmacokinetics of affected
drugs. Rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine are selected as typical BCRP
substrates, both in the lists of the United States FDA and Japanese DI
guidelines. Rosuvastatin is a nonmetabolized type of statin and is
mainly excreted into bile and partly excreted into the urine in an
unchanged form. Multiple transporters such as OATP1Bs, Naþ-
taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), P-gp, MRP2, and
OAT3 are involved in the regulation of rosuvastatin pharmacoki-
netics [ 68e70]. Thus, it is dif ﬁcult to identify the major cause of DIs
only from clinical DI outcomes; in vitro experimental results should
also be considered in parallel.
For example, cyclosporin A is thought to be an inhibitor of in-
testinal BCRP, and co-administration of cyclosporin A led to a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the plasma AUC of rosuvastatin [ 71]. However,
previous reports clearly indicate that the major cause of the DI
between rosuvastatin and cyclosporin A is the inhibition of hepatic
OATP1B transporters by cyclosporin A, though BCRP inhibition also
partly contributes to its AUC increase [ 72,73]. As for sulfasalazine,
because its bioavailability is about 7%, it is expected sensitively
catch the functional change of intestinal BCRP. This is supported by
a previous clinical result in which plasma AUC of sulfasalazine insubjects with ABCG2 c.421C >A is about 5-fold higherthan subjects
with the wild-type allele [ 74]. Conversely, the aqueous solubility of
sulfasalazine shows that it is practically insoluble and largely de-
pends on pH, while its clinical dose is relatively high. Thus, the
fraction of the dose absorbed from the intestinal wall may depend
on the dose of sulfasalazine. In addition, because the number of
examples is very small at this moment, imatinib is also listed in the
Japanese DI guideline because its trough plasma concentration
normalized by dose was signi ﬁcantly larger in subjects with ABCG2
c.421C >A, though the AUCR was not available [ 75].
4.1.3. Substrates of OATP1B1/OATP1B3
OATP1B1/1B3 are exclusively expressed on the basal membrane
of hepatocytes and are responsible for the hepatic uptake of sub-
strate drugs. Because of the broad substrate speci ﬁcities of
OATP1B1/1B3, many types of example drugs are listed in the Jap-
anese DI guideline. The United States FDA selected the drugs when
the following criteria were satis ﬁed: AUCR is /C212 in clinical DI
studies with a single dose of rifampicin or cyclosporin A or with
pharmacogenetic alteration in subjects with SLCO1B1 c.521T >C,
and the in vitro transport by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 expression
systems has been con ﬁrmed. Rifampicin and cyclosporin A have
been con ﬁrmed to be potent clinically relevant OATP1B inhibitors
from in vitro inhibition studies (rifampicin [600 mg]: [I
u,in,max ] (the
expected maximum concentration of the inhibitor at the inlet to the
liver adopted by the Japanese DI guideline)/IC50 ¼5.55 [1.19 e24.4]
for OATP1B1, 1.11 [0.914 e53.2] for OATP1B3; cyclosporin A
[200 mg]: [I u,in,max ]/IC50 ¼4.85 [0.740 e63.8] for OATP1B1, 4.83
[0.933 e37.9] for OATP1B3 (the geometric mean [range] of [I u,in,max ]/
reported K ior IC50 values was used when estradiol-17 b-glucuro-
nide was used as a substrate in transporter-expression systems)).
OATP1B1/1B3 substrates, which were selected by the United
States FDA, are listed in the Table 2 e3 in the Japanese DI guideline
(Table 4 in this review), but danoprevir is only listed in the United
States FDA table simply because it has not been approved in Japan.
Various types of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are listed
because all the acid forms of statins are con ﬁrmed to be substrates
of OATP1B1/1B3 in vitro [73]. Among these statins, pitavastatin,
rosuvastatin, and pravastatin are excreted into bile mostly in an
unchanged form, while atorvastatin and ﬂuvastatin are extensively
metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C9, respectively, after their hepatic
uptake via OATP1Bs. Among the listed drugs, some of them are
subsequently metabolized by P450s; thus, the impact on their
pharmacokinetics should be taken into consideration in theK. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414
13interpretation of DI outcomes. Watanabe et al. have shown that
in vivo hepatic clearances of four types of statins are well predicted
from in vitro uptake clearance in human hepatocytes rather than
from in vitro metabolic clearance with human liver microsomes,
suggesting that OATP1B1/1B3-mediated hepatic uptake is a rate-
determining process of hepatic clearance even for metabolized
type of statins [ 76]. A previous microdosing clinical DI study with
atorvastatin further supported its uptake-limited hepatic clearance
in vivo in humans because the plasma AUC of parent atorvastatin
was greatly increased by the oral administration of rifampicin
(OATP1Bs inhibitor), while it was not changed by the intravenous
administration of itraconazole (hepatic CYP3A inhibitor) [ 77]. Flu-
vastatin is now quali ﬁed as a listed drug because a recent DI study
showed that the AUCR of ﬂuvastatin is 2.4 by single oral dose of
rifampicin (600 mg) and this is almost to the same as those of
pitavastatin and rosuvastatin [ 78].
In the interpretation of clinical DI results, we must pay attention
to the fact that statins are also recognized by multiple transporters
other than OATP1Bs. For example, pitavastatin is a substrate of P-gp,
MRP2, and BCRP [ 79], though the contribution of intestinal BCRP to
the suppression of intestinal absorption of pitavastatin wasconsidered to be minor because of its high bioavailability. In the
case of rosuvastatin, the partial contribution of NTCP to the hepatic
uptake was reported [ 68], and it is also a substrate of P-gp, MRP2,
and BCRP [ 69]. Pravastatin is thought to be mainly excreted into bile
via MRP2 [ 80]. Moreover, these two statins are partially (~30%)
eliminated from the kidney mainly via OAT3.
Other than statins, several NS3/4A protease inhibitors for the
treatment of hepatitis C are also known to be substrates of OATP1Bs
and some DI cases have recently been reported. AUCRs of sime-
previr, grecaprevir, and grazoprevir were reported to be 6.2, 8.6,
and 8.4 when rifampicin (600 mg, 300 mg, and 200 mg, respec-
tively) was orally co-administered [ 81]. The number of OATP1B
substrate drugs has been increasing and we must continuously
collect information on the pharmacokinetic properties of newly
approved drugs. For instance, pema ﬁbrate, a selective PPAR
a
modulator ﬁrst approved in Japan, is a substrate of OATP1Bs ac-
cording to the package insert, and co-administration of rifampicin
(600 mg) and cyclosporin A (600 mg) greatly increased the plasma
AUC of pema ﬁbrate 11- and 14-fold, respectively; thus, these are
designated as contraindicated drugs.
4.1.4. Substrates of OAT1/OAT3
OAT1 and OAT3 are expressed on the basal membrane of renal
proximal tubular epithelial cells and play important roles in the
renal secretion of anionic drugs. The United States FDA selected the
drugs when the following criteria were satis ﬁed: the AUCR is /C211.5
in clinical DI studies with probenecid, the fraction excreted into the
urine in an unchanged form is /C210.5, and the in vitro transport by
OAT1 or OAT3 expression systems has been con ﬁrmed. In the drug
list of the Japanese DI guideline (Table 2-3), some drugs (bumeta-
nide, cipro ﬂoxacin, fexofenadine, and zidovudine) were newly
added to the list of the United States FDA's website because pre-
vious clinical reports indicated that the AUCR (or steady-stateplasma concentration (only for bumetanide)) of these drugs was
/C211.5 on co-administration of probenecid (probenecid [1000 mg]:
[I
u,max ]/IC50 ¼0.14e6.1 for OAT1, 0.69 e29 for OAT3 [the range of
reported K ior IC50 values was used]). As for fexofenadine, though
its fraction excreted into urine is <0.5 (12%) and it is also a sub-
strate of hepatic OATP1B transporters [ 61,63], the functions of OAT1
and OAT3 can be directly evaluated from its renal clearance, which
is calculated by dividing the cumulative amount of drugs excreted
unchanged in the urine by blood AUC. So, the second criterion by
the United States FDA is not necessarily important to evaluate the
change in the functions of OAT1 and OAT3 once renal clearance ofdrugs is quanti ﬁed. The same is true for pravastatin and rosuvas-
tatin, 30% of which are excreted unchanged into urine via OAT3.
Regarding penicillin G, a previous report supported the claim
that it can also meet the above-mentioned criteria as an in vivo
OAT3 probe substrate because the plasma concentration of peni-
cillin G was increased 2.1-fold by the oral co-administration of
750 mg of probenecid [ 82]. This quantitative DI information was
not available when the tables were being originally created for the
Japanese guideline; thus, penicillin G is also quali ﬁed as an in vivo
OAT3 probe substrate in the review.
In general, substrate speci ﬁcities of OAT1 and OAT3 are different.
OAT1 preferentially accepts low molecular weight and hydrophilic
compounds as substrates compared with OAT3 [ 83]. The molecular
properties of OAT3 substrates resemble those of hepatic OATP1B
transporters. The relative contribution of OAT1 and OAT3 to the
uptake of listed drugs into proximal tubular epithelial cells is of
great variety. Based on several methods reported previously to
quantify their contributions [ 84,85], adefovir, ganciclovir, and p-
aminohippurate (PAH) are selective substrates of OAT1, whereas
penicillin G, bumetanide, cipro ﬂoxacin, and oseltamivir carboxylate
are selective substrates of OAT3. So, it is noted that the selection ofsubstrate drugs from Tables 2 e3 in the Japanese DI guideline
(Table 4 in this review) depends on the putative target transporter
for renal DIs.
4.1.5. Substrates of OCT2/MATEs
OCT2 is expressed on the basal (blood) side of renal epithelial
cells, while MATEs are expressed on the apical (urine) side. The
cooperative functions of OCT2 and MATEs in the kidney partly
realize the ef ﬁcient transcellular transport of various organic cat-
ions. The United States FDA selected only one drug, metformin,
because it is a well-established substrate of the cationic transport
system.
Metformin is well-known to be mainly excreted into the urine
by active secretion mediated by OCT2/MATEs. Clinical evidence,
such as DI and pharmacogenetic studies, as well as animal exper-
iments supported the importance of OCT2/MATEs in the renal
clearance of metformin in vivo [86e88].
4.2. Notes for the selection of in vivo typical inhibitors of
transporters ( Table 5 )
As for transporter inhibitors, the United States FDA also showed
similar types of drug lists on their website ( https://www.fda.gov/
drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-
interactions-table-substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers#table5-2 ); a
part of the inhibitor drugs for each transporter is different from
those in the Japanese DI guideline (Table 2 e4 in the guideline).
4.2.1. Inhibitors of P-gp
Many drugs have been nominated as in vivo typical inhibitors of
transporters in the tables of both the United States FDA's website
and Japanese DI guideline, though some of the listed drugs are notidentical between these tables. The United States FDA selected the
drugs when the following criteria were satis ﬁed: the AUCR of
digoxin is /C212 in clinical DI studies and the in vitro inhibition of P-gp
has been con ﬁrmed. However, according to the drug-interaction
database, DIDB ( http://www.druginteractioninfo.org ), the AUCR of
digoxin is within the range of 1.5 e2.0 in co-administration as with
most of the listed drugs ( Table 5 ). For the practical use of these
inhibitors, we should pay attention to the evidence in which most
of these inhibitors also inhibit CYP3A; thus, even if the plasma
concentration of a drug is increased by co-administration of the
listed inhibitors, the major mechanism of DIs cannot be simply
determined using clinical DI studies.K. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414
14Compared with the list of the United States FDA's website,
cyclosporin A and azithromycin were also listed in Table 2-4 in the
Japanese DI guideline ( Table 5 in this review). A previous case
report indicated that cyclosporin A decreased plasma clearance of
digoxin 0.47-fold and cyclosporin A potently inhibits P-gp in in vitro
experiments as mentioned above [ 89]. Other clinical data also
strongly suggested that cyclosporin A works as a clinically relevant
P-gp inhibitor. However, the interpretation of the clinical DI
outcome with cyclosporin A must be made with caution because it
also inhibits intestinal BCRP and CYP3A, and hepatic OATP1B1/
OATP1B3. As for azithromycin, though a clinical DI study with
digoxin is not available at the moment, the in vitro inhibition po-
tency of azithromycin was strong enough to inhibit intestinal P-gp
in humans ([I] g/IC50¼61.2 at 250 mg dose) [ 90], and a previous
report indicated that azithromycin signi ﬁcantly increased the
plasma AUC of fexofenadine 1.7-fold [ 90].
Although propafenone is only listed in the United States FDA
table but not in the Japanese guideline, a previous clinical DI study
showed that the plasma concentration of digoxin was increased
1.8-fold by co-administration of propafenone (300 mg/8 h for 3
days) [ 91] and the in vitro inhibition potency has been con ﬁrmed
([I]g/IC50¼173, 517 at 300 mg dose) [ 92]. Thus, propafenone can
also be quali ﬁed as a P-gp inhibitor drug. Ranolazine, dronedarone
and tipranavir/ritonavir are not included in the list in the Japanese
guideline simply because they have not been approved in Japan.
4.2.2. Inhibitors of BCRP
The United States FDA selected the drugs when the following
criteria were satis ﬁed: the AUCR of sulfasalazine is /C211.5 in clinical
DI studies and the in vitro inhibition of BCRP has been con ﬁrmed.
However, only curcumin meets those criteria because clinical DI
studies with sulfasalazine are very rare at the moment. The
disadvantage of the use of curcumin for a DI study is that a large
amount of dose (2 g) is required to inhibit BCRP in humans [ 93]. The
United States FDA also considers cyclosporin A and eltrombopag as
BCRP inhibitors because they increase the plasma AUC of rosuvas-
tatin 6.1-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively [ 71,94]. However, it should
be noted that a major mechanism of DI between rosuvastatin and
cyclosporin A is considered to be the inhibition of hepatic OATP1B1/
OATP1B3 rather than the inhibition of intestinal BCRP [ 73]. Thus,
cyclosporin A is not included in the list of the Japanese guideline. A
recent paper suggested that the clinical dose of eltrombopag may
also partly inhibit hepatic OATP1B1/OATP1B3 [ 95]. Therefore, there
is no good speci ﬁc inhibitor for BCRP at the moment. To check
whether the intestinal absorption of a drug is dominated by BCRP,
another option is to compare its plasma concentrations in subjects
with the ABCG2 c.421C >A mutation with those in subjects with
wild-type ABCG2 , as mentioned above.
4.2.3. Inhibitors of OATP1B1/OATP1B3
The United States FDA selected the drugs when the following
criteria were satis ﬁed: the AUCR of one of the clinical substrates in
the United States FDA list is /C212 in clinical DI studies and the in vitro
inhibition of OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3 has been con ﬁrmed. Among
these drugs, rifampicin has been frequently used in OATP1B-
mediated clinical DI studies because its pharmacological effect isrelatively mild among the listed OATP1B inhibitors. Because
rifampicin also works as a strong inducer of P-gp, some P450 iso-
enzymes (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2B6, and 3A) whose genes are regulated
by the nuclear receptor PXR, and possibly OATP1B1 [ 96e98] (some
controversial results have also been published [ 99e102]), repeated
dosing of rifampicin must be avoided and a single dose of rifam-
picin (typically 600 mg) should be used to evaluate the impact of
hepatic OATP1B transporters on the pharmacokinetics of affected
drugs. All the listed OATP1B inhibitors have an inhibition potencyfor intestinal P-gp and CYP3A to some extent, so we should be
careful in clinical DI data interpretation. Although gem ﬁbrozil has
not been approved in Japan and it is not listed in the Japanese
guideline, it mildly increased the plasma AUC of various types of
statins 1.1 e2.0-fold, except cerivastatin (5.6-fold) [ 103] because of a
combination of mechanism-based inhibition of hepatic CYP2C8 by
gem
ﬁbrozil glucuronide and inhibition of hepatic OATP1B trans-
porters by both gem ﬁbrozil and its glucuronide [ 25].
4.2.4. Inhibitors of OAT1/OAT3
Probenecid is the only drug listed in the Japanese guideline that
is a potent inhibitor for both OAT1 and OAT3. K ivalues of proben-
ecid for OAT1 (4.0 mM) and OAT3 (3.5 mM) are reported to be almost
the same [ 82], so probenecid is considered to inhibit both OAT1 and
OAT3 to the same extent in humans. Thus, the relative contribution
of OAT1 and OAT3 to the renal uptake of OAT1/OAT3 substrate
drugs cannot be determined only from clinical DI studies with
probenecid. A previous report demonstrated that 750 mg of pro-
benecid signi ﬁcantly decreased the renal clearance of adefovir (an
OAT1-selective substrate) and penicillin G (an OAT3-selective
substrate) by 82% and 54%, respectively, and the dose-dependentchange in their renal clearances could be reasonably explained by
in vitro K
ivalues for OAT1 and OAT3 and the average unbound
plasma concentration of probenecid at each dose [ 82].
On the other hand, the United States FDA selected two additional
drugs, PAH and teri ﬂunomide as OAT1/OAT3 inhibitors based on the
following criteria: the AUCR of one of the clinical substrates in the
United States FDA table is /C211.5 in clinical DI studies and the in vitro
inhibition of OAT1 and/or OAT3 has been con ﬁrmed. A previous
report demonstrated that PAH meets the above-mentioned criteria as
anin vivo relatively selective inhibitor for OAT1 because a large dif-
ference in K ivalues for OAT1 and OAT3 was con ﬁrmed in vitro and the
plasma concentration of adefovir was increased by 1-h continuous
infusion of PAH at the rate of 120 mg/min, and a dose-dependent
change in its renal clearance could be explained by in vitro Kivalues
for OAT1 and average unbound plasma concentration of PAH at each
dose [ 82]. This quantitative DI information was not available at the
time the tables were being originally created for the Japanese
guideline; thus, PAH is useful for the selective inhibition of OAT1 in
the human kidney. However, unexpectedly, PAH clearly increased the
renal clearance of penicillin G in a dose-dependent manner, which
might be caused by the inhibition of the reabsorption process of
penicillin G via unidenti ﬁed transporter(s) [ 82].
Repeated dosing of teri ﬂunomide increased the plasma AUC of
cefaclor 1.5-fold, suggesting that it inhibits renal OAT3 in humans
[104]. On the otherhand, an interpretation of clinical DI results should
be made with caution because teri ﬂunomide may also inhibit
CYP2C8, BCRP, and OATP1B1/OATP1B3 because plasma AUCs of
repaglinide and rosuvastatin were increased 2.3- and 2.5-fold,
respectively [ 104].In vitro IC50 values of teri ﬂunomide for BCRP,
OATP1B1, and OAT3 were 0.146, 7.4, and 1.03 mM, respectively,
resulting in [I] g/IC50¼1420 (for BCRP), [I u,in,max ]/IC50 ¼0.231 (for
OATP1B1 (unbound fraction is set as 0.01)) and [I u,max ] (the maximum
unbound concentration of the inhibitor in the blood)/IC50 ¼1.63 (for
OAT3 (unbound fraction is set as 0.01)) at 14 mg dose [ 104].
4.2.5. Inhibitors of OCT2/MATEs
The listed inhibitors for OCT2/MATEs in the Japanese guideline
and FDA's website are almost the same. The United States FDA
selected the drugs when the following criteria were satis ﬁed: the
AUCR of metformin is /C211.5 in clinical DI studies and the in vitro
inhibition of OCT2 and/or MATEs has been con ﬁrmed. In Table 5 ,
the inclusion criteria were met for all the listed drugs. Isavucona-
zole and ranolazine are not included in the list in the Japanese
guideline because they have not been approved in Japan.K. Maeda, A. Hisaka, K. Ito et al. Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 41 (2021) 100414
15The reason why pyrimethamine is included in the Japanese
guideline is that it is well-validated as a MATEs-selective inhibitor.
In vitro inhibition assay of pyrimethamine for renal cation transport
systems revealed its highly selective inhibition of MATEs (K ifor
MATE1: 0.151 [0.0193 e93.5] mM, MATE2-K: 0.136 [0.01 e1.50] mM
(geometric mean [range] of reported K ior IC50 values in
transporter-expression systems)) compared with OCT2 (K i¼6.17
[0.61 e160] mM). A similar tendency is also observed for cimetidine
(Kifor OCT2: 59.9 [1.8 e1650] mM, MATE1: 2.15 [0.093 e16.3] mM,
MATE2-K: 8.14 [2.1 e46.6] mM), trimethoprim (K ifor OCT2: 61.4
[6.9e1330] mM, MATE1: 3.56 [0.51 e29.1] mM, MATE2-K: 0.445
[0.03 e28.9] mM), and vandetanib (K ifor OCT2: 6.18 [0.4 e73.4] mM,
MATE1: 0.337 [0.06 e1.23] mM, MATE2-K: 0.297 [0.04 e1.26] mM),
which suggests that they also preferentially inhibit MATEs rather
than OCT2. Conversely, inhibition potencies of dolutegravir for
OCT2 (K i¼2.12 [0.066 e23]mM) and MATEs (K ifor MATE1: 4.99
[3.6e6.34] mM, MATE2-K: 19.4 [9.3 e49.3] mM) are similar. However,
the unbound maximum plasma concentration of dolutegravir is
0.11mM at 50 mg dose, which is less than the K ivalues for OCT2 and
MATEs. Thus, clinical DIs with dolutegravir may not be simply
explained by the inhibition of OCT2 and MATEs.
5. Other clinically evident pharmacokinetic DIs
In this review, we have focused on P450 and transporter-
mediated DIs, because it is currently dif ﬁcult systematically to
manage the DIs of the other mechanisms. Nevertheless, it is
important to know the risks of clinically evident DIs of the other
mechanisms. In addition to P450, multiple metabolizing enzymes,
including ﬂavin monooxygenase (FMO), monoamine oxidase
(MAO), xanthine oxidase (XO), and aldehyde oxidase (AO) [ 105,106],
various esterases and peptidases [ 107], as well as conjugating en-
zymes such as UGT [ 108] and sulfotransferase [ 109] play important
roles in the regulation of drug clearance. Among these, glucur-
onidation is the most commonly observed metabolizing enzyme
next to P450, and it has been elucidated that multiple isoenzymes of
UGT are expressed in the liver, small intestine, and kidney [ 110].
However, the information of DIs on the selectivity of substrates
or inhibitors is not fully clari ﬁed for UGT compared with those for
P450. It has been reported that drugs such as valproic acid [ 111],
lamotrigine [ 112], zidovudine [ 113], deferasirox [ 114], canagli ﬂozin
[115], and raltegravir [ 116] are extensively glucuronidated without
phase I metabolism, but the degrees of DI due to UGT inhibition are
relatively moderate with AUC changes of less than double for most
of these drugs [ 117] except for a DI between valproic acid and
carbapenem, which is described later. However, when these drugs
are used in combination with strong inducers, such as rifampicin,
evident decreases in AUC have been observed.
When carbapenems, such as panipenem or meropenem, are
used in combination with valproic acid, the blood concentration of
valproic acid is remarkably reduced, as if the glucuronidation ac-
tivity is increased [ 118]. It has been reported that the mechanism of
this interaction involves irreversible inhibition of the enzyme that
hydrolyzes the valproic acid conjugate and returns it to valproic
acid [ 119,120]. Currently, there are no known drugs that interact
with carbapenem by this mechanism other than valproic acid.
It has also been reported that evident pharmacokinetic DIs occur
due to ﬂuctuations in absorption [ 121e123]. Some of these DIs are
described in the Japanese guideline.
6. Concluding remarks
Problematic DIs mediated by P450s and transporters are often
observed in clinical studies or even post-approval, therefore it is
very important systematically to evaluate the risks of such DIs andtake the necessary precautions at the right timing. The classi ﬁcation
of drugs presented in this study allows for a better understanding of
the mechanism or potency for pharmacokinetic DIs and will support
efﬁcient drug development and the realization of improved phar-
macotherapy in clinical practice. As we have discussed in this re-
view, however, there are still many open issues in this area. Even in
the short term after the publication of the Japanese guideline, novel
quantitative DI information that was not available at the time the
tables were being created has become available such as substrates ofOATP1Bs, OAT3, and OCT2/MATEs (pema ﬁbrate, penicillin G, and
dofetilide, respectively) or an inhibitor of OAT (PAH). Thus, the tables
that were created based on current pharmacokinetic knowledge
should be updated appropriately if new information appears in the
future. It is also noteworthy that an activity to seek indus-
tryegovernment eacademia collaboration to update and maintain
the FDA's list has been reported [ 124]. Individual regulatory stan-
dards for the evaluation of DIs have been issued in the EU, Japan, and
the US, however, the international council for harmonization of
technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH) has
started activities to harmonize the evaluation of DIs during drug
development ( https://www.ich.org/page/multidisciplinary-
guidelines ). It is expected that the harmonized guidelines will
contribute to reducing the uncertainty of development or short-
ening the development period. Even if the mechanism is uncom-
mon, such as the DI of sorivudine, it is necessary to manage clinically
occurring risks meticulously [ 125]. The clinical signi ﬁcance of DIs
should be considered regarding not only the pharmacokinetic
impact but also whether the pharmacokinetic changes affect the
therapeutic effect or lead to safety concerns. We should use the
classi ﬁcation with understanding its bene ﬁts and limitations
thoughtfully for evaluation and management of all potential DIs.
