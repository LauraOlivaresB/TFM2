EDP- 305 is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist that selectively activates FXR and 
is a potential treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with 
liver fibrosis. Results from preclinical studies indicate that CYP3A4 is the primary 
enzyme involved in EDP- 305 metabolism and that EDP- 305 has low potential to 
inhibit or induce cytochrome (CYP) isoenzymes and drug transporters. Four studies 
were conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the drug– drug interaction (DDI) 
potential of EDP- 305 co- administered with drugs known to be substrates for drug 
metabolizing enzymes or transporters, and to assess the effect of inhibitors and in-
ducers of CYP3A4 on EDP- 305. Results suggest caution when substrates of CYP3A4 
are administered concomitantly with EDP- 305. A potential for increased exposure 
is apparent when CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index are adminis-
tered with EDP- 305. In contrast, substrates of drug transporters can be administered 
concomitantly with EDP- 305 with a low potential for interactions. Coadministration 
of EDP- 305 and a combined OC had no relevant effects on plasma concentrations 
of the combined OC. Co- administration of EDP- 305 with strong or moderate inhibi-
tors and inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended. These results indicate low overall 
likelihood of interaction of EDP- 305 and other substrates through CYP mediated 
interactions. The interaction potential of EDP- 305 with drug transporters was low 
and of unlikely clinical significance. The EDP- 305 DDI profile allows for convenient 
administration in patients with NASH and other patient populations with comor-
bidities, with minimal dose modification of concomitant medications.
Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?
Drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters are implicated in clinically signifi-
cant drug interactions. An important aspect for a new chemical entity is to estab-
lish the drug interaction potential early in the development process.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
EDP- 305 is a farnesoid X receptor agonist that is a potential treatment for non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Based on preclinical studies, EDP- 
305 had a low potential to inhibit cytochrome (CYP) isoenzymes. Four studies    | 2147
DRUG- DRUG INTERACTION POTENTIAL WITH EDP- 305
INTRODUCTION
EDP- 305 is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist that 
selectively activates FXR and is being developed as a 
potential treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steato-
hepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. Preclinical studies in-
dicated that EDP- 305 potently regulates the expression of 
FXR target genes in vivo and is hepatoprotective in mul-
tiple rodent models of liver injury and NASH.1– 3 In phase 
I studies, EDP- 305 was well- tolerated in healthy subjects 
at single doses up to 80 mg and in subjects with or with-
out presumed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
at multiple daily doses up to 20 mg for 14 days.4 In a 12-  
week, phase II study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of EDP- 305 in 132 non- cirrhotic patients with 
fibrotic NASH, treatment with EDP- 305 reduced hepatic 
enzyme levels and liver fat with a tolerability profile that 
was consistent with other FXR agonists.5
Results from preclinical studies indicate that EDP- 
305 has a low potential to inhibit cytochrome (CYP) 1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 isoenzymes or to in-
duce CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 in standard hepatic micro -
some studies. However, incubation in liver microsomes 
(hepatocytes) in the presence of EDP- 305 resulted in a 
concentration-  dependent downregulation of messenger 
RNA (mRNA) for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, consistent with 
similar pharmacodynamic effects seen with other FXR 
agonists.6,7 The latter effects on mRNA for CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 did not translate into effects on enzyme levels in 
standard in vitro assays but warranted further investiga-
tion in the clinic.
Additional in vitro studies suggest the potential for 
EDP- 305 to inhibit organic anion- transporting poly -
peptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 with a low poten-
tial to inhibit bile salt export protein (BSEP), multidrug 
resistance- associated protein 2 (MRP2), P-  glycoprotein (P- gp), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) trans -
porters. EDP- 305 is unlikely to be a BCRP substrate but 
has potential to be a P-  gp substrate (data on file).
In clinical studies, EDP- 305 geometric mean terminal 
half- life (t1/2) values were similar across all dose levels for 
fasted and fed subjects and ranged from 11.12 to 14.98 h, 
following single doses, and 9.86 to 21.2 h following mul-
tiple doses.4 In a radiolabeled mass balance study, fecal 
excretion was the predominant route of elimination for 
EDP- 305, with observed mean recovery of total radioac-
tivity of 78.7% in feces and 1.42% in urine (unchanged 
drug). EDP- 305 was not detected in urine, indicating 
no urinary clearance of EDP- 305 (data on file; Enanta 
Pharmaceuticals).
After single doses of EDP- 305 (ranging from 1 to 80 mg), 
the increase in mean peak and systemic exposures in fasted 
subjects was slightly greater than dose- proportional. EDP-  
305 exposures generally appeared to increase with mul-
tiple dosing (with doses ranging from 0.5 to 20 mg), with 
little accumulation at doses <10 mg (accumulation index 
of 1.13– 1.74) and moderate to high accumulation at doses 
greater than or equal to 10 mg (accumulation index of 2.21–  
5.50) in healthy subjects and subjects with presumptive 
NAFLD. Based on visual inspection of the trough concen-
trations, steady-  state pharmacokinetics (PKs) appeared to 
be reached by day 9 across all doses.
Because of the potential for clinically relevant drug– 
drug interactions (DDIs) with various drug metabolizing 
enzymes or drug transporters, a series of phase I clinical 
studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate 
the potential for DDIs with EDP- 305. These DDI studies 
were conducted at clinically relevant doses, and their re -
sults were applied to completed studies in patients with 
NASH.5
The DDI potential of EDP- 305 was evaluated at doses 
of 2.5 (tablet), 5 (tablet) or 10 mg (suspension), and these evaluated the potential of EDP- 305 with other drugs known to be substrates for 
drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?
These results indicate caution with co- administration of EDP- 305 with drugs that 
are CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 substrates because of potentially clinically significant 
effects, and co- administration of EDP- 305 with strong or moderate inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended. The drug– drug interaction potential 
of EDP- 305 with transporters or other agents was low and of unlikely clinical 
significance.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR 
TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?
The results from these four studies with EDP- 305 support the rationale for thor-
ough investigation of potential clinically relevant drug interactions with new 
chemical entities.2148 |

dose levels are in line with EDP- 305 doses that were ad-
ministered in patients with NASH.5 Patients with NASH 
are reported to have a different metabolic profile than 
healthy subjects, and plasma exposures in patients 
with NASH are usually higher than healthy subjects.8 
In the case of EDP- 305, the exposures in patients with 
NASH are approximately twofold higher than healthy 
subjects at the same dose/formulation (data on file). A 
relative bioavailability assessment indicated that EDP-  
305 tablet has approximately twofold higher exposures 
compared to the suspension (data on file). Results from 
phase I studies in healthy subjects and subjects with 
presumptive NAFLD4 and a phase II study in subjects 
with NASH5 suggest that the optimal therapeutic dosage 
range for EDP- 305 is 1– 2 mg (tablet) once daily. Thus, 
these DDI studies were conducted at clinically relevant 
doses.
METHODS
Each study was conducted in accordance with the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance 
with the International Conference on Harmonization 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The protocol and 
amendments and the informed consent documents were 
approved by independent ethics committees/institutional 
review boards (Midlands IRB, Overland Park, KS). All 
subjects provided written informed consent prior to par-
ticipation in any study procedures.
Subjects
For all studies, eligible subjects were between 18 and 
55 years (18– 45 years in study 008) with a body mass index (BMI) of 18– 30 kg/m2 (18– 32 kg/m2 in study 008). Subjects 
were healthy based on a medical evaluation; female sub-
jects were of non- childbearing potential (except in study 
008), and male subjects agreed to use effective contracep-
tion and refrain from sperm donation until 90 days after 
the last dose of study drug. Subjects refrained from caf-
feine use from 72 h prior to the study until discharge from 
the clinic. Detailed exclusion criteria are provided in the 
Data S1.
Study design
All four studies were open- label, single center studies 
conducted in healthy subjects. Each study consisted of a 
screening period that was up to 28 days, an inpatient treat-
ment period, and a follow up at 6 or 7 days after discharge 
from the study site. Below is an overview of DDI studies 
(Table 1), with individual study details below.

Study 004 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03187496)
Subjects were confined to a clinical pharmacology re-
search unit during the study, were discharged on day 17, 
and returned for a follow- up visit on day 22 (flow chart 
in Material S1). Subjects abstained from caffeine starting 
72 h before day 1 and continuing through discharge from 
the clinic. Single oral doses of midazolam 2 mg and caf-
feine 200 mg were administered on days 1 and 12; on days 
2 and 13, a single oral dose of rosuvastatin 20 mg was ad-
ministered; on days 5 to 15, a daily oral dose of EDP- 305 
was administered (10 mg). Caffeine, midazolam, and rosu-
vastatin were provided as commercially available formu-
lations. EDP- 305 was administered as an oral suspension 
containing 10 mg/30 ml in the morning after an overnight 
fasting. Plasma samples were collected on days 1 and 2 
and days 12 and 13 to determine concentrations of mida-
zolam and caffeine and their metabolites. Plasma samples 
were collected on days 2 through 5 and days 13 through 
16 to determine concentrations of rosuvastatin and its me-
tabolites. Plasma samples were collected predose on days 
5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 to determine trough 
EDP- 305 concentrations. Subjects were discharged on day 
17 with a follow- up visit on day 22.
Study 005 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03213145)
Oral itraconazole 200 mg (2 × 100 mg capsules) was 
administered once daily on days 5– 18 in part 1; oral ri-
fampin 600 mg (2 × 300 mg capsules) was administered 
once daily on days 5– 16 in part 2. Oral EDP- 305 10  mg 
(10  mg/30 ml suspension) was administered once daily 
on days 1 and 14 in both part 1 and part 2 (flow chart in 
Material S1). Rifampin and EDP- 305 were administered 
after a 10 h overnight fast that continued for at least 4 h 
postdose. Itraconazole was administered while fasted 
when co- administered with EDP- 305, but in a fed state 
when administered alone. This was done due to the food 
effect observed on EDP- 305 (enhanced exposure, data on 
file), to avoid confounding that effect with metabolic in-
hibition. Otherwise, itraconazole was administered in the 
fed state per package insert. Plasma samples to determine 
concentrations of EDP- 305 and its metabolites were col-
lected predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h 
postdose on days 1 and 14 of part 1 and part 2 and be-
fore the morning dose of itraconazole at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after the dose of EDP- 305 on days 15 through 19 in 
part 1. In part 2 (enrolling subjects different from part 1), 
plasma samples were collected before the morning dose of 
rifampin at 24, 48, and 72 h after the dose of EDP- 305 on 
days 15 through 17. Subjects were discharged on day 17 or 
day 19 with a follow up visit 6– 7 days later.
Study 007 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03610945)
In part 1, oral fluconazole 400 mg (2 × 200 mg tablets) was 
administered once daily on days 5 through 18, and a single 
oral dose of EDP- 305 5 mg (tablet) was administered on 
days 1 and 14. In part 2 (enrolling subjects different from 
part 1), an oral dose of quinidine 300 mg (tablet) was ad-
ministered twice daily on days 5 through 12, and a single 
oral dose of EDP- 305 5 mg (tablet) was administered on 
days 1 and 8 (flow chart in Material S1). All doses were 
administered after a 10  h overnight fast and for at least 
4 h postdose. Plasma samples to measure concentrations 
of EDP- 305 and its metabolites were collected predose and 
at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postdose on 
days 1 and 14 in part 1 and on days 1 and 8 in part 2. In 
addition, plasma samples were collected at 24, 48, 72, 96, 
and 120 h after the dose of EDP- 305 on days 15 through 
19 in part 1 and on days 9 to 13 in part 2. Subjects were 
discharged from the inpatient unit on day 19 in part 1 and 
day 13 in part 2 with a follow- up visit 6– 7 days later.
Study 008 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03783897)
This was a crossover design study, where the same 
subjects underwent a lead- in period, part 1, and part 2 
(flow chart in Material S1). Subjects self- administered 
the study OC (35 μg ethinyl estradiol [EE] and 250 μg 
norgestimate [NGM]) during a 29- day lead- in period. In 
part 1, the study consisted of an outpatient visit on day 
14 (±2), an inpatient stay on days 20– 23, and an outpa-
tient visit on day 28 (−3). In part 2 (the same subjects 
as in part 1), the study consisted of an inpatient stay on 
days 10– 23 and an outpatient visit on day 28 (−3). In 
both parts 1 and 2, subjects received a tablet of the ac-
tive OC on days 1 through 21 and an inert tablet on days 
22 through 28. In part 2, an oral dose of 2.5 mg EDP- 305 
(tablet) was co- administered with the OC on days 11– 21 
at approximately the same time each day. EDP- 305 was 
taken with an overnight fast of at least 10 h and for a 
minimum of 4 h postdose. In part 1, plasma samples for 
measuring NGMN (NGM active metabolite), levonorg-
estrel (LNG, NGM active metabolite), and EE concen-
trations were collected predose on days 14 and 20, and 
on day 21 predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 2150 |   
AHMAD and ADDA
and 24 h (day 22) postdose. In part 2, plasma samples for 
assessment of NGM, LNG, and EE concentrations were 
collected predose on days 14 and 20, and on day 21 pre-
dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h (day 22) 
postdose. Plasma samples to measure concentrations of 
EDP- 305 and its metabolites were collected predose on 
days 14 and 20, and on day 21 predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h (day 22) postdose. Subjects 
returned to the inpatient unit for a follow up visit 7 days 
(+2 days) after their last dose.
Analytical methods
Concentrations of EDP- 305 and its metabolites (EP- 022571, 
EP- 022572, and EP- 022679) in human plasma were quan-
tified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
with tandem mass spectrometric (LC– MS/MS) detec-
tion with an assay range of 0.0300– 30.0 ng/ml (004, 005: 
Medpace Bioanalytical Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH, 007, 
008: Covance Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT). Plasma 
concentrations of midazolam, caffeine, and rosuvastatin 
and their respective metabolites (1′- hydroxymidazolam, 
4′- hydroxymidazolam, paraxanthine, and N- desmethyl- 
rosuvastatin) were analyzed using validated method-
ology (Covance Central Laboratory, Indianapolis, IN). 
Plasma concentrations of EE, NGM, and LNG were de-
termined using a validated analytical procedure (Covance 
Laboratories). Details for assay methodology are provided 
in the Data S1.
Pharmacokinetics
Generally, all available data was used per analyte for PK 
parameter determination, per standard practice. The pre-
dose sample result was included in parameter estimation, 
if the value was quantifiable. PK parameters included 
area under the plasma concentration– time curve, from 
time 0 to the last measurable non- zero concentration cal-
culated by the linear up/log down method (AUC0- t); area 
under the plasma concentration– time curve from time 0 
extrapolated to infinity (AUC0- inf); maximum plasma con-
centration (Cmax); apparent t1/2; time to reach Cmax (Tmax); 
apparent terminal elimination rate constant (lambda z); 
apparent total clearance from plasma (CL/F); apparent 
volume of distribution (Vd); predose plasma concentra-
tion (Ctrough ); metabolite- to- parent plasma AUC0- inf ratio 
(AUCR0- inf).
Plasma PK parameters were estimated using noncom-
partmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3 
or version 8.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, 
CA). Actual sampling times were used and values below the limit of quantitation were considered missing. PK pa-
rameters by treatment were provided using descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, min, max, GM, 
and % coefficient of variation [%CV]).
Statistical analysis
The effect of concomitant administration of EDP- 305 on 
a substrate or effect of a probe on EDP- 305 was assessed 
using the ratio and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of 
the geometric mean of the plasma PK parameters: Cmax, 
AUC0- t, AUC0- inf, and AUCR0- inf. A linear mixed model 
with a fixed effect for treatment and a random effect 
for subject was used for natural log- transformed Cmax, 
AUC0- t, AUC0- inf, and AUCR0- inf parameters. Geometric 
least- squares means were provided for each treatment. In 
all comparisons, substrate administered alone was used as 
the reference. No adjustments were made for multiplicity.
In addition, for study 008, the pooled estimate (across 
all treatments) of within-  subject CV was calculated. This 
procedure was equivalent to Schuirmann’s 2 one-  sided 
tests at the 0.05 level of significance. A statistical anal-
ysis using Wilcoxon signed- rank test was conducted to 
compare the Tmax of the test treatment to the Tmax of the 
reference treatment on PK profile day 21 for EE, NGM, 
and LNG analytes. For each PK parameter and treatment, 
median was calculated. Hodges- Lehmann estimates of the 
median of the differences and the related 90% CIs were 
calculated for comparison between test and reference 
treatments.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of subjects from each study are 
shown in Table  2. Characteristics were typical of a popu-
lation of healthy subjects. Subjects were predominantly 
men, except for the OC study (008), not Hispanic or 
Latino, and approximately equally divided between White 
and Black or African American.
Pharmacokinetics
EDP- 305 as perpetrator
In study 004, mean midazolam plasma concentrations over 
time generally were higher when co- administered with 
EDP- 305 (Figure  1). When EDP- 305 was co- administered 
with the CYP3A4 probe substrate, midazolam, a 1.25- fold 
increase in the Cmax, a 1.53- fold increase in the AUC0- t, 
and a 1.55- fold increase in the AUC0-∞ of midazolam was    | 2151
DRUG- DRUG INTERACTION POTENTIAL WITH EDP- 305
observed (Table  3). The increase in midazolam AUC was 
less than twofold, indicating that EDP-305 is a weak in-
hibitor of CYP3A4. EDP- 305 co- administered with mi-
dazolam resulted in a delayed Tmax (↑98%), lower Vd/F 
(↓14%), lower CL/F (↓36%), and longer t1/2 (↑34%) for mi-
dazolam. Based on the magnitude of this effect, caution 
should be exercised when substrates of CYP3A4 are ad-
ministered concomitantly with EDP- 305.
In study 004, mean caffeine plasma concentrations 
over time generally were higher when co- administered 
with EDP- 305. When co- administered with caffeine, a 
CYP1A2 probe, EDP- 305 marginally increased caffeine 
Cmax by 1.13- fold, AUC0- t by 1.90- fold, and AUC0-­∞ by 1.95- 
fold (Table  3). The increase in caffeine AUC was less than 
twofold, indicating that EDP- 305 is a weak inhibitor of 
CYP1A2. EDP- 305 co- administered with caffeine resulted 
in a delayed Tmax (↑50%), lower CL/F (↓45%), and longer 
t1/2 (↑64%) but had little effect on the Vd/F for caffeine. 
Based on the magnitude of this effect, CYP1A2 substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index may have potential for 
increased exposure when administered with EDP- 305.
In study 004, mean rosuvastatin plasma concentrations 
over time generally were higher when co- administered with 
EDP- 305. When co- administered with rosuvastatin, a probe 
for BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3, EDP- 305 marginally increased 
the rosuvastatin Cmax by 1.11- fold, AUC0- t by 1.24- fold, and 
AUC0-­∞ by 1.24- fold (Table  3). The increase in rosuvastatin 
AUC was less than 1.25- fold, suggesting that EDP- 305 is un-
likely to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP 
transporters. EDP- 305 co- administration with rosuvastatin 
had no apparent effect on Tmax and Vd/F (↓ 6%), but resulted 
in lower CL/F (↓ 20%), and longer t1/2 (↑17%) for rosuvas -
tatin. Based on the magnitude of this effect, substrates of 
BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 can be administered concomi-
tantly with EDP- 305.The metabolite- to- parent ratio data was available (based 
on quantifiable concentrations) for both midazolam and 
rosuvastatin metabolites, 1′- hydroxymidazolam, and N- 
desmethyl- rosuvastatin, respectively. The metabolite- to- 
parent ratio based on total systemic exposure (AUCR0- inf) 
decreased when midazolam was administered with 
EDP- 305 compared to when it was administered alone. 
When midazolam was administered with EDP- 305, GM 
AUCR0- inf was 20.6% compared to 39.1% when adminis -
tered alone. The metabolite- to- parent ratio based on total 
systemic exposure (AUCR0- inf) decreased when rosuvasta-
tin was administered with EDP- 305 compared to when it 
was administered alone. When rosuvastatin was adminis -
tered with EDP- 305, GM AUCR0- inf was 11.2% compared 
to 16.6% when administered alone.
An exploratory objective of study 004 was to assess 
trough levels of EDP- 305 and its metabolites in the presence 
and absence of single doses of midazolam, caffeine, and 
rosuvastatin. As indicated by generally comparable trough 
concentrations from day 12 onward, steady-  state concentra-
tions of EDP- 305 and its metabolites were achieved by day 
12 in the majority of subjects. Co- administration of metab -
olizing enzyme or transporter probes had no apparent effect 
on the PK of EDP- 305 and its metabolites.
In study 008, mean plasma concentrations of EE, NGM, 
and LNG were comparable whether the OC was adminis -
tered alone or combined with EDP- 305 (Figure  2). Peak and 
systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC0- τ) of EE and NGM were 
similar following co- administration of the combined OC 
with EDP- 305 or administration of OC alone (Table  3). A 
slight increase (1.3- fold) in LNG Cmax and AUC0- τ was ob -
served following the co- administration of the OC with EDP-  
305 compared to OC alone. Following co- administration of 
OC with EDP- 305, the median Tmax of EDP- 305 was 4.0 h 
and the geometric mean t1/2 was 9.6 h.TABLE 2 Baseline characteristics of subjects in each study

EDP- 305 metabolites (EP- 022571, EP- 022572, and EP- 
022679) were also evaluated. Metabolite EP- 022571 was 
less abundant than the parent with respective geometric 
mean AUC0- τ (MRAUC) ~ 0.892% of the parent. Metabolite 
EP- 022572 was less abundant than the parent with mean 
MRAUC ~ 1.74% of the parent. Metabolite EP- 022679 was 
less abundant than the parent with mean MRAUC of 
~6.30% of the parent. The MRAUC appeared to be higher for EP- 022679 (0.0630) compared to EP -022571 (0.00892) 
and EP- 022572 (0.0174), indicating that EP- 022679 was 
the most abundant metabolite of the three metabolites 
tested in this study.
In addition, co- administration of the combined OC 
and EDP -305 had no effect on serum progesterone levels, 
and mean progesterone concentration was below 3  μg/L 
throughout the study.FIGURE 1 Mean plasma

DRUG- DRUG INTERACTION POTENTIAL WITH EDP- 305
Based on these assessments, EDP- 305 does not ap -
pear to affect the PKs of a combined OC or serum pro -
gesterone levels as no relevant changes were observed 
following co- administration of the OC with EDP- 305 
compared to the OC alone. These results suggest that 
a combined OC may be considered an acceptable form 
of contraception for premenopausal female patients re -
ceiving EDP -305 therapy.EDP- 305 as victim
In study 005, mean plasma itraconazole concentra-
tions, the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, were markedly 
higher when coadministered with EDP- 305 compared 
with itraconazole alone (Figure  3). When EDP- 305 was 
co- administered with itraconazole, EDP- 305 peak and 
systemic exposures increased by ~1.6-  and 5.3- fold, TABLE 3 Statistical comparison of pharmacokinetic exposure parameters after co-administration of EDP-305 with different probes

respectively (Table  3). Co- administration of itracona-
zole with EDP- 305 resulted in a relatively delayed Tmax 
(2- fold), lower Vd/F (0.47- fold), lower CL/F (0.81- fold), 
and longer t1/2 (2.79- fold) for EDP- 305. These PK results 
are consistent with inhibition of a major metabolic path-
way (CYP3A4).
Following co- administration with itraconazole, the 
peak exposure decreased 0.84- fold, 0.45- fold, and 0.63- fold for metabolites EP- 022571, EP- 022572, and EP- 022679, 
respectively. The total exposure (AUC0- t and AUC0- inf) 
increased 1.99- fold to 2.29- fold in all metabolites except 
EP- 022571, for which AUC0- t decreased 0.66- fold. The 
t1/2 could not be calculated for metabolite EP- 022679 and 
could not be reliably estimated for EP- 002571 due to the 
limited number of evaluable subjects (n  =  5). However, 
t1/2 increased 3.88- fold for EP- 022572.FIGURE 2 Mean plasma

DRUG- DRUG INTERACTION POTENTIAL WITH EDP- 305
Furthermore, in study 007, mean plasma EDP- 305 con-
centrations were markedly higher when co- administered 
with. Fluconazole versus EDP- 305 alone (Figure  4). 
When EDP- 305 was co- administered with the moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, fluconazole, EDP- 305 peak and sys -
temic exposures increased by ~1.8-  and 3.8- fold, respec-
tively (Table  3). EDP- 305 CL/F and Vd/F were decreased, 
and the t1/2 increased when EDP- 305 was co- administered 
with fluconazole compared to when EDP- 305 was admin-
istered alone.
The co- administration of fluconazole with EDP- 305 re -
sulted in a decrease in EP- 022571 Cmax (55%), AUC0- t (39%), 
and AUC0- inf (34%) relative to EDP- 305 administered alone. 
Additionally, EP- 022571 t1/2 increased (1.9- fold) when 
EDP- 305 was co- administered with fluconazole relative to 
EDP- 305 administered alone, whereas Tmax was similar. EP-  
022572. The co- administration of fluconazole with EDP- 305 
resulted in a slight decrease in EP- 022572 Cmax (24%) and an 
increase in AUC0- t (1.9- fold), and AUC0- inf (1.8- fold), relative 
to EDP- 305 administered alone. Additionally, EP- 022572 
t1/2 increased (2.9- fold) when EDP- 305 was co- administered 
with fluconazole relative to EDP- 305 administered alone, 
whereas Tmax was similar.The co- administration of fluconazole with EDP- 305 re -
sulted in an increase in EP- 022679 Cmax (1.5- fold), AUC0- t 
(3.0- fold), AUC0- inf (2.2- fold), delayed Tmax (1.5- fold lon-
ger), and higher t1/2 (3.3- fold).
These PK results are also consistent with inhibition of a 
major metabolic pathway (CYP3A4), similar to study 005.
In study 005, mean plasma EDP- 305 concentrations 
were markedly lower when co- administered with rifam-
pin versus EDP- 305 alone (Figure  3). When EDP- 305 was 
co- administered with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifam-
pin, no apparent effect on EDP- 305 peak exposure was 
observed, but total systemic exposure decreased by ~65% 
(Table  3). The co- administration of rifampin with EDP- 
305 had no apparent effect on Tmax but resulted in a rela-
tively higher Vd/F (1.79- fold), higher CL/F (2.77- fold), and 
shorter t1/2 (0.35- fold) for EDP- 305.
The major metabolites of EDP- 305 generally increased 
when EDP- 305 was co- administered with rifampin com-
pared to when EDP- 305 was administered alone. The 
peak exposure increased 1.58- fold, 2.77- fold, and 1.66- fold 
for metabolites EP- 022571, EP- 022572, and EP- 022679, 
respectively. The total exposure (AUC0- t and AUC0- inf) 
increased 1.05- fold to 1.25- fold for EP- 022571, and FIGURE 3 Mean plasma 
concentrations of EDP- 305 following 
co- administration with itraconazole (top) 
or rifampin (bottom).
2156 |   
AHMAD and ADDA
EP- 022572 decreased 0.39- fold for EP- 022679. The t1/2 de-
creased 1.54-  to 1.79- fold for all metabolites.
Taken together, the lower exposures of EDP- 305 and 
the generally increased exposures of the major metabo -
lites of EDP- 305, are consistent with increased metabo -
lism and clearance of the parent drug and indicate that 
the metabolism of EDP- 305 was induced by the strong 
CYP3A4 inducer rifampin.
These PK results are consistent with induction of a 
major metabolic pathway (CYP3A4). Based on these re -
sults, co- administration of EDP- 305 with strong or moder -
ate inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended.
In study 007, mean plasma quinidine concentrations 
were comparable when co- administered with EDP- 305 
versus quinidine alone (Figure  4). When EDP- 305 was co- 
administered with the selective P-  gp inhibitor, quinidine, 
no apparent effect on EDP- 305 peak or systemic exposure 
was observed (Table  3). Co- administration of quinidine 
with EDP- 305 had minimal effect on Tmax, Vd/F, CL/F, and 
t1/2 for EDP- 305. The PK results are consistent with lack of 
an effect of P-  gp on EDP- 305.
The co- administration of quinidine with EDP- 305 
resulted in a decrease in EP- 022571 Cmax (36%), AUC0- t (39%), and AUC0- inf (36%) relative to EDP- 305 adminis -
tered alone, whereas the Tmax and t1/2 were not impacted. 
The PK parameters of EP- 022572 were generally similar 
when EDP- 305 was administered alone or in combination 
with quinidine. The co- administration of quinidine with 
EDP- 305 resulted in an increase in EP- 022679 Cmax (1.4- 
fold), AUC0- t (1.6- fold), AUC0- inf (1.5- fold), and higher t1/2 
(1.6- fold), whereas Tmax was not impacted.
Based on these results, no dose adjustments are antici-
pated when EDP- 305 is co- administered with quinidine or 
other P-  gp inhibitors or inducers.
Detailed PK results from each study are provided in the 
Data S1.
Safety/tolerability
In these four studies, EDP- 305 generally was well- 
tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) were 
headache, diarrhea, and pruritus, and most AEs were 
of mild or moderate severity. No deaths or serious AEs 
considered related to EDP- 305 were reported. No clini-
cally significant findings were reported from physical FIGURE 4 Mean plasma

DISCUSSION
Clinically significant drug interactions are an important 
cause of hospitalization and increased healthcare costs 
in the United States.9 A wide range of drug metaboliz-
ing enzymes as well as drug transporters have been 
implicated as causes of clinically significant drug inter-
actions.10,11 Thus, an important aspect of drug develop-
ment for a new chemical entity is to determine the drug 
interaction potential early in the development process 
to avoid serious, potentially life- threatening complica-
tions.10,11 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
and European regulatory authorities have established 
guidance for industry for evaluating the drug interac-
tion potential of drugs.12,13 The FDA Guidance provides 
definitions for the magnitude of an effect on CYP en-
zymes and OATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP transporters based 
on the increase of AUC for the probes as weak (≥ 1.25 but 
<2- fold increase), moderate (≥ 2 but <5- fold increase), 
and strong (≥ 5- fold increase).13
Previous work suggests the potential for clinically sig -
nificant drug interactions with FXR agonists. In human 
hepatocytes, a potentially clinically significant interac-
tion was identified between FXR agonists and CYP3A4.14 
Studies in healthy subjects with the FXR agonist, obe -
ticholic acid, identified a significant interaction with 
CYP1A2.15 Because of the complex nature of NASH, a 
need exists to evaluate the potential for interactions with 
drugs being developed for NASH because of the frequent 
use of concomitant medications.16
On the basis of results from preclinical studies, four 
phase I studies were conducted in healthy subjects to 
characterize the DDI potential of EDP- 305. These stud-
ies used guidelines provided by regulatory agencies for 
the design of studies to explore drug interaction poten-
tial of drugs. From studies of EDP- 305 co- administered 
with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, caution should be 
exercised when substrates of CYP3A4 are administered 
concomitantly with EDP- 305, and co- administration 
of EDP- 305 with strong or moderate inhibitors and in-
ducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended. In addition, 
CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index 
may have the potential for increased exposure when 
co- administered with EDP- 305; therefore, monitoring 
drug concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates with a nar -
row therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine and theophyl-
line) is recommended. In contrast, substrates of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 can be administered concomitantly 
with EDP- 305 with a low potential for DDIs. Further, 
no dose adjustments are anticipated when EDP- 305 is 
co- administered with quinidine or other P-  gp inhibitors 
or inducers. Co- administration of EDP- 305 and a com-
bined OC had no relevant effects on plasma concentra-
tions of the combined OC components, which suggests 
that a combined OC may be considered an acceptable 
form of contraception for premenopausal female pa-
tients receiving EDP- 305.
Of note, these four studies evaluated the DDI potential 
of EDP- 305 at doses of 2.5 (tablet), 5 (tablet), or 10 mg (sus -
pension). A relative bioavailability assessment indicated 
that EDP- 305 tablet has approximately twofold higher ex -
posures compared to the suspension (data on file). Results 
from phase I studies in healthy subjects and subjects with 
presumptive NAFLD4 and a phase II study in subjects with 
NASH5 suggest that the optimal therapeutic dosage range 
for EDP- 305 is 1– 2 mg (tablet) once daily. These DDI studies 
were conducted at clinically relevant doses, and can be ap -
plied to future studies in patients with NASH. A phase IIb 
study in NASH is currently ongoing (NCT04378010).
There are no dose adjustments for EDP- 305 or con-
comitant medications based on all four study results 
(co- administration of EDP- 305 with strong or moderate 
inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended, 
with no dose adjustment a priori). The magnitude of ef-
fect on concomitant medications estimated from the DDI 
studies is expected to be a worst-  case scenario as healthy 
volunteers may have higher levels of functional enzymes 
(e.g., CYP3A4) compared to patients with NASH,8 and 
thus results from the DDI studies presented here are ex -
pected to translate and have been already applied, to stud-
ies in patients with NASH. Of note, cirrhotic subjects were 
excluded from current NASH studies.
In summary, the EDP- 305 DDI profile allows for conve -
nient administration in patients with NASH and other pa-
tient populations with comorbidities, with minimal dose 
modification of concomitant medications.
