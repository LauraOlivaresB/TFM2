Abstract: Membrane transporters play an important role in the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion of xenobiotic substrates, as well as endogenous compounds. The evaluation of
transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is an important consideration during the drug
development process and can guide the safe use of polypharmacy regimens in clinical practice. In
recent years, several endogenous substrates of drug transporters have been identiﬁed as potential
biomarkers for predicting changes in drug transport function and the potential for DDIs associated
with drug candidates in early phases of drug development. These biomarker-driven investigations
have been applied in both preclinical and clinical studies and proposed as a predictive strategy that
can be supplanted in order to conduct prospective DDIs trials. Here we provide an overview of this
rapidly emerging ﬁeld, with particular emphasis on endogenous biomarkers recently proposed for
clinically relevant uptake transporters.

1. Introduction
Membrane transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC)
super families are now widely recognized as important determinants of the absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion of many xenobiotic compounds, and for many
of these transporters, physiological substrates have been identiﬁed [ 1,2]. The increasing
application of polypharmacy regimens, in conjunction with current regulatory require-
ments, demands that new investigational drugs are evaluated as substrates or inhibitors
of select transporters in the early stages of development in order to predict the liability
for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) [ 3]. In the last few years, signiﬁcant progress has been
made in evaluating endogenous metabolites as potential clinical biomarkers to predict
transporter-mediated DDIs, in particular those in which the drug of interest is a suspected
perpetrator [ 4]. This is based on the tenet that such drugs, once administered, can reach
levels sufﬁciently high to inhibit transporters that fulﬁll a role in the movement of known
endogenous substrates, and that this inhibition is accompanied by measurable, acute,
and temporal increases in the systemic concentration of those substrates. Metabolomics,
a systems-wide omics analysis of endogenous metabolites in biological samples, is one
commonly used approach to identify the endogenous substrates of drug transporters
that could serve as a biomarker in humans and other species [ 5]. In combination with
the use of animals with a genetic deﬁciency of a transporter or human subjects with
genetic predisposition of altered transporter function, these metabolomics studies can
facilitate the discovery of novel endogenous substrates of drug transporters [ 6,7]. Follow-
ing appropriate in vitro and in vivo validation, such substrates can then be explored as
a potential predictive biomarker and be further used in vivo to assess the potential for
transporter-mediated DDIs. In the current article, we provide an overview of this rapidly
emerging ﬁeld of endogenous transporter biomarkers, focus on its application to predict

2. Organic Anion Transporters 
Organic anion transporters (OATs), along with organic anion-transporting polypep-
tides (OATPs), organic cation transporter (O CTs), organic cation and carnitine transport-
ers (OCTNs), and multidrug and toxin extrusions proteins (MATEs) [8], are a SLC family 
of transporters that have been most commonly  associated with the transport of xenobiotic 
drugs. These transporters are expressed in ke y organs of elimination such as kidney and 
liver, as well as in other organs such as the intestine and brain, and play an important role 
in maintaining normal homeostasis, mediatin g drug absorption and disposition proper-
ties [9]. OATPs and OATs are the major or ganic anion-type transporters, where OATPs 
typically transport relatively large and fairly hydrophobic organic anions, while OATs 
transport smaller and more hydrophilic organic anions [9]. Recent preclinical and clinical 
studies have identified and validated severa l endogenous substrates as potential bi-
omarkers for organic anion-type transporters (Table 1).

2.1. OATP1B1 and OATP1B3
Organic anion-transporting polypeptides comprise a family of transporters expressed
in various tissues [ 42]. In humans, OATP1B1 [ SLCO1B1 ] and OATP1B3 [ SLCO1B3 ] (col-
lectively referred to as OATP1B hereafter) are partially redundant transporters that are
highly expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes and play key roles in the
hepatic uptake of drugs [ 43–45]. Inhibition of OATP1B can lead to defective elimination,
result in increases in plasma concentration of drugs that are substrates of these transporters,
delayed clearance, and ultimately increase the risk of therapy-related side effects [ 45,46].
Both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA)
guidelines require under certain conditions that in vitro studies are performed to evaluate
whether investigational new drugs are potential substrates or inhibitors of OATP1B [ 47,48].
A multitude of endogenous substrates of OATP1B have been identiﬁed in the past fewMolecules 2021 ,26, 5500 4 of 16
years and some of these have been proposed as potential biomarkers in conjunction with
clinical evaluations of OATP1B-mediated DDIs [4,5,49].
2.1.1. Bilirubin
Bilirubin is the end product of heme breakdown and its hepatocellular uptake is
at least partially dependent on OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 [ 50]. After bilirubin enters the
liver, it is detoxiﬁed by UGT1A1-mediated conjugation to form bilirubin-glucuronide and
bilirubin-di-glucuronide. Most of the bilirubin glucuronides are subsequently excreted into
bile by MRP2 [ ABCC2 ], but some of the conjugated bilirubin is efﬂuxed back into the sinu-
soidal blood by MRP3 [ ABCC3 ] and enter a shuttling-loop (called ‘hepatocyte-hopping’)
and be taken up by neighbouring hepatocytes in an OATP1B-dependent manner [ 50,51].
The role of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in the hepatic uptake of conjugated and unconju-
gated bilirubin has been conﬁrmed by several preclinical and clinical studies. In vitro
studies showed that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substantially contribute to unconjugated
bilirubin uptake in adult hepatocytes [ 10,11].In vivo studies using a Slco1b2 knockout
(Oatp1b2-null) mouse model further revealed that Oatp1b2, the single murine orthologue
of human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, is important in the hepatic uptake of unconjugated and
conjugated bilirubin [ 52,53]; studies using humanized OATP1B1, OATP1B3 transgenic mice
showed partial or complete rescue of increased plasma bilirubin levels [ 54,55]. Consistent
with these preclinical observations, it has been reported that carriers of impaired function
variants in the genes encoding OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 have signiﬁcantly elevated levels of
unconjugated bilirubin [ 56,57]. More interestingly, subjects with rotor syndrome manifest
clinically with extensive hyperbilirubinemia, and this phenotype has been causally con-
nected with a rare condition associated with a complete loss of function of both OATP1B1
and OATP1B3 [58–60].
The utility of using bilirubin and its conjugated forms as endogenous biomarkers
to assess OATP1B-mediated DDIs potential has been extensively evaluated. In rats ad-
ministered 20 or 80 mg/kg rifampin, a known OATP1B inhibitor, the plasma levels of
total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin were signiﬁcantly and dose-dependently elevated
compared with rats receiving vehicle alone [ 61]. In cynomolgus monkeys, after single
oral administration of 18 mg/kg rifampin, a 2.4-, and 3.0-fold elevation of unconjugated
and conjugated bilirubin has been observed [ 62]. Furthermore, administration of rifampin
(300 or 600 mg) in healthy volunteers increased the concentrations of direct bilirubin in a
dose-dependent manner; the AUC 0–24h of direct bilirubin was 2.3- and 3.5-times higher
than the control values [ 13]. This ﬁnding was independently veriﬁed in another study
involving healthy subjects receiving 150, 300, or 600 mg rifampicin [ 12]. Although bilirubin
has been shown to be sensitive to OATP1B inhibitors and the alteration in bilirubin level
correlates well with changes observed in other xenobiotic OATP1B substrates, such as
the drugs atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and valsartan [ 12], it remains unclear to what extent
other transporters (ABCC2, ABCC3) and enzymes (UGT1A1) of relevance contribute to
the elimination of bilirubin, which therefore diminishes its speciﬁcity as a biomarker. It
is worth pointing out that serum bilirubin levels are also used as a biomarker for liver
injury, and any changes in bilirubin levels must be carefully evaluated, and the data need
to be analysed in a manner that can distinguish between reversible inhibition of hepatic
OATP1B, ABCC2, ABCC3, and/or UGT1A1 versus liver injury [49].
2.1.2. Coproporphyrin I and III
Coproporphyrins (CPs) are by-products of heme synthesis, and two of these, CP-I
and CP-III, are of particular interest in the context of functional OATP1B modulation; CP-I
and CP-III are metabolically stable and eliminated in bile and urine, respectively, as intact
forms in humans [ 63]. CP-I and CP-III are relatively selective substrates for OATP1B1
and OATP1B3 [ 14,64]. In mice study, CPs level in plasma and urine were signiﬁcantly
increased in Oatp1a/1b gene cluster knockout mice (Oatp1a/1b–/–), compared with wild-
type animals (7.1- to 18.4-fold) [ 64]. In cynomolgus monkey, administration of OATP1BMolecules 2021 ,26, 5500 5 of 16
inhibitors cyclosporin A (100 mg/kg, oral) or rifampicin (15 mg/kg, oral) increased plasma
levels of CP-I and CP-III by 2.6- and 5.2-fold, 2.7- and 3.6-fold, respectively [ 64]. Although
CP-I and CP-III are relative speciﬁc OATP1B substrates, none of them are transported
by OCT1 [ SLC22A1 ], OCT2 [ SLC22A2 ], OAT3 [ SLC22A8 ], or NTCP [ SLC10A1 ]; CP-III is
identiﬁed to be OATP2B1 substrate [ 14], which leads to the hypothesis that CP-I might
reﬂect OATP1B function more precisely. This concept is further supported by data obtained
from healthy volunteers, in which the plasma concentration of CP-I was increased most in
subjects with homozygous carriers of the OATP1B1*15 [ 18,65]. Consistently, CP-I plasma
level were not altered by administration of agents not known to inhibit OATP1B, such as
itraconazole and diltiazem [66,67].
The utility of CP-I and CP-III as suitable endogenous clinical biomarkers of OATP1B
function has been evaluated in several studies. In healthy subjects with a South Asian
Indian background, the administration of 600 mg of rifampicin in combination with 5 mg
of rosuvastatin, resulted in 4.0- and 3.3-fold increase in plasma AUC levels of CP-I and
CP-III, respectively, when compared with rosuvastatin given alone [ 16], these changes
in response to rifampin were consistent with observations obtained from another study
with mixed ethnicities [ 66]. It is important to note that the increase in CP-I in response to
rifampin in healthy subjects was greater than several other potential OATP1Bs biomarkers
measured simultaneously [ 12,23,68]. The magnitude effect of CP-I alteration suggests that
it is sensitive to differentiate weak, moderate, and strong OATP1B inhibitors reﬂected by
altered plasma level of CP-I. This hypothesis was independently veriﬁed by Kunze et al. in
which strong ( 5 fold AUC increases; e.g., rifampicin), moderate (2–3 fold AUC increase;
e.g., simeprevir), and weak (no change; e.g., the investigational agent JNJ-A) OATP1B
inhibitors were used to test CP-I sensitivity [69]. The superiority of CP-I over CP-III as an
OATP1B1 endogenous biomarker was recently supported in a clinical study where CP-I
Cmaxratio and AUC ratio relative to baseline were correlated with increasing exposure of
glecaprevir (GLE), a drug known to cause clinical inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3, whereas
only modest correlation between GLE exposure and CP-III C maxratio but no correlation
with CP-III AUC ratio were observed [ 15]. More recently, CPs have been applied as
endogenous OATP1B biomarkers to elucidate in vivo inhibition potency of the anticancer
drug, paclitaxel, a known inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in patients with non–small
cell lung cancer [ 17]. These collective studies have provided compelling evidence that CP-I
is an emerging promising endogenous biomarker with higher selectivity and sensitivity to
predict the risk of OATP1B transporter-mediated DDIs in humans.
2.1.3. Bile Acids
Bile acids emulsify dietary fats, eliminate cholesterol, and clear hepatic catabolites.
Bile acids are synthesized in the liver by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol
and are stored in the gall bladder and released into the intestinal lumen via the bile duct,
reabsorbed in the ileum, and returned to the liver, thus completing the enterohepatic
circulation [ 70,71]. The primary bile acids are synthesized and conjugated in the liver,
subsequently secreted into the bile. In the intestine, primary bile acids are deconjugated
and dehydroxylated by enzymes originating from the gut microﬂora to form the secondary
bile acids. Via enterohepatic circulation, the secondary bile acids are transported to the
liver and recycled. Hepatic uptake, the last step in enterohepatic circulation, is a key
process in regulating the amount of circulating bile acids. Several primary and secondary
bile acids have been identiﬁed as OATP1B transporter substrates. As shown from a
metabolomics study using Oatp1b2-null mice, levels of unconjugated bile acids were 3-
to 45-fold higher than in wild-type mice, including -muricholic acid ( MCA, 45-fold),
cholic acid (CA, 38-fold), -muricholic acid ( MCA, 25-fold), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA,
15-fold), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 11-fold), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 3-fold),
and deoxycholic acid (DCA, 2.3-fold) [ 72].In vitro studies conﬁrmed that CA, CDCA, and
DCA are OATP1Bs substrates, as well as their respective glycine and taurine conjugates,
and the conjugated bile acids (glycine and taurine) are superior to unconjugated bileMolecules 2021 ,26, 5500 6 of 16
acids as substrates for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 [ 73]. In cynomolgus monkeys, rifampin
treatment (18 mg/kg single oral dose) resulted in signiﬁcantly elevated plasma levels of
several bile acids, such as glycolic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), and
glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) compared with the vehicle control [ 62]. Similarly, plasma AUC
of sulphate conjugates of BAs including GDCA-S, GCDCA-S, taurochenodeoxycholate
(TCDCA-S), DCA-S, and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA-S) presented a robust dose-response to
oral rifampicin (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys [ 74]. The clinical use of
bile acids as surrogate endogenous biomarkers for DDIs involving OATP1B1 and OATP1B3
has been explored in healthy volunteers. One study reported 20.3 fold increase of GCDCA-
S after the single dose administration of rifampicin (600 mg, oral) [ 20], a ﬁnding that is
in line with a study in which dose-dependent effects of rifampicin (150, 300, or 600 mg)
on several putative biomarkers (bilirubin, CP-I, and bile acids) was examined [ 12]. These
investigations suggest that a number of bile acids, including GCDCA-S, GCDCA-G, GDCA-
G, GDCA-S, CDCA-24G, lithocholate sulfate (LCA-S), glycolithocholate sulfate (GLCA-
S), and taurolithocholate sulfate (TLCA-S), can be further explored for the quantitative
assessment of potential OATP1B-mediated DDIs in humans [ 13,17,18]. It is worth noting
that bile acids are also substrates for other transporters (e.g., GCDCA-S is substrate of
NTCP and OAT3), and often altered by disease conditions, which together attenuated the
use of bile acids as a potential speciﬁc OATP1Bs function.
2.1.4. Tetradecanedioate (TDA) and Hexadecanedioate (HDA)
The fatty acid dicarboxylates tetradecanedioate (TDA) and hexadecanedioate (HDA)
have been identiﬁed as substrates of OATP1B1 as well as OAT1 and OAT3, and could
potentially serve as endogenous biomarkers of OATP1B [ 7]. In rats, probenecid (a weak
OATP1B inhibitor) increased plasma concentrations of HDA, and the tissue uptake clear-
ance of deuterium-labelled HDA ( d-HDA) in the liver was 16-fold higher than that in the
kidney. The hepatic uptake clearance was reduced by 80% by probenecid, suggesting that
HDA might be a biomarker for OATP1B that is minimally affected by urinary and biliary
elimination in rats [ 75]. In healthy subjects, the administration of the OATP1B inhibitors
rifampin (600 mg) or cyclosporin A (100 mg) also signiﬁcantly increased plasma AUC of
TDA and HDA [ 19,23,68], and the effects on HDA were dependent on the rifampicin dose
(150, 300, or 600 mg) [12].
2.2. OAT1 and OAT3
The organic anion transporter OAT1 [ SLC22A6 ] and OAT3 [ SLC22A8 ] are mainly
expressed on the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubular cells and mediate cellular
uptake of substrates from the blood into the kidney [ 1]. Inhibition of these transporters
reduces drug renal clearance and can lead to DDIs. Taurine and GCDCA-S have been
identiﬁed as endogenous OAT1/3 substrates using metabolomics analysis and DDI studies
in healthy subjects receiving probenecid, a potent inhibitor of OATs. Along with in vitro
evidence, taurine and GCDCA-S may potentially serve as endogenous biomarkers for
assessing DDIs with these transporters [ 21]. However, the selectively of taurine and
GCDCA-S as OAT1/3 endogenous biomarker is limited because of involvement of urine
reabsorption with taurine and the interaction with other transporters (OATP1B1 and
OATP1B3) for GCDCA-S. Recently, pyridoxic acid (PDA) and homovanillic acid (HVA)
were identiﬁed as endogenous substrates of OAT1/3 using untargeted metabolomics
analysis and DDI studies in cynomolgus monkeys receiving 40 mg/kg probenecid. In vitro
study further conﬁrmed PDA and HVA are substrates for human OAT1 and OAT3 [ 25].
Several most recent studies from healthy subjects suggested that PDA was a promising
endogenous biomarker for OAT1/3 function sensitivity in response to weak, moderate, and
strong OAT1/3 inhibitors [ 24,76]. In a recent study, Willemin et al. systemically tested the
selectivity of PDA, HVA, GCDCA-S and taurine towards different renal transporters [ 22].
Using in vitro transporter overexpressing cell lines, this study demonstrated that PDA
and HVA are substrates of OAT1/2/3, OAT4 [ SLC22A11 ] (PDA only), MRP4 [ ABCC4 ],Molecules 2021 ,26, 5500 7 of 16
GCDCA-S was a substrate of OAT3 and MRP2, and taurine was not a substrate of the tested
transporters. In addition, the same study found that PDA was the most sensitive plasma
biomarker in response to strong and selective OAT inhibitor probenecid (500 mg every
6 h), while GCDCA-S was the most sensitive OAT biomarker based on renal clearance [ 22].
Taken together, the fact that the inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by probenecid is
unlikely to be remarkable [ 21], this study suggests that the combined monitoring of PDA
and GCDCA-S from both urine and plasma should be recommended to tease out the
involvement of OAT1/3 in DDIs [ 22]. Recently, metabolomics analyses of the serum of
Oat1 and Oat3 knockout mice revealed remarkable changes in tryptophan derivatives
involved in metabolism and signalling, suggesting that these metabolites can potentially
be used as endogenous biomarkers to determine if drug candidates interact with OAT1
and/or OAT3 [77].
3. Organic Cation Transporters
The organic cation transporters (OCTs) are a group of poly-speciﬁc transporters
with largely overlapping substrate selectivity, which include OCT1 [ SLC22A1 ], OCT2
[SLC22A2 ], OCT3 [ SLC22A3 ], OCTN1 [ SLC22A4 ], OCTN2 [ SLC22A5 ], MATE1 [ SLC47A1 ],
and MATE2-K [ SLC47A2 ]. Their function is to transport organic cations, zwitterions, and
some uncharged compounds as facilitated diffusion systems and/or antiporters, and they
modulate the distribution of many endogenous compounds such as thiamine, creatinine,
and neurotransmitters [ 78]. However, organic cation transporters also play an important
role in the absorption, distribution, and excretion of hydrophilic drugs and therefore can
be critically important contributors to DDIs [ 79]. Among the tested potential biomarkers of
OCTs, N1-Methylnicotinamide (NMN) has been most extensively evaluated as endogenous
biomarkers for the assessment of changes in the activity of renal OCT2/MATEs, while
thiamine is widely discussed for OCT1 [ 29,31,32,80]. Given the overlapping substrate
speciﬁcity of OCT2 and MATEs, many endogenous substrates proposed as biomarkers
cannot be easily discriminated between these respective transporters (Table 1).
3.1. Thiamine
Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is an essential vitamin that is found at low levels in most
foods [ 81]. Under physiologic conditions, elimination of thiamine is mainly extrarenal,
although when given at high doses, renal excretion may become the principal path of
elimination due to the saturation of other pathways [ 82,83]. The urinary elimination is pre-
dominantly associated with glomerular ﬁltration, consistent with its low molecular weight
and the lack of protein binding, although tubular secretion and reabsorption processes may
also be probably involved. At physiologic conditions, the result is net reabsorption of thi-
amine [ 29,84], whereas under thiamine-deﬁcient conditions, the renal excretion rate drops
toward zero due to reabsorption [ 83]. When thiamine plasma concentrations are increased
(>200 nM by i.v. administration) clearance increases to values close to estimated renal
blood ﬂow, which could be a sign of saturation of reabsorption while secretion processes
remain unsaturated [83].
Thiamine is reported to be a substrate of MATE1 ( Km= 0.83–3.5 M), MATE2K
(Km= 3.9 M) [ 27,29,85], OCT1 ( Km= 0.78 M), OCT2 ( Km= 0.75–59.9 M) [ 27,86], thi-
amine transporter (THTR) 1 [ SLC19A2 ] and THTR2 [ SLC19A3 ] (Km= 2.5 M and 27 nM,
respectively) [ 86,87] through in vitro transport studies. Its renal clearance is non-linear in
humans and under normal conditions below the glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), suggest-
ing it undergoes active tubular reabsorption, possibly mediated by THTR1 and THTR2 [ 49].
Clinical evidence supporting thiamine as an endogenous biomarker to any of the above
transporters is very limited, though multiple studies using transporter deﬁcient mice
suggested the role of transporters in thiamine disposition. An untargeted metabolomics
study from healthy subjects revealed that renal clearance of thiamine was substantially
reduced (70–84%) in the subjects treated with MATEs inhibitor pyrimethamine compared
with the control group, which suggests that MATEs account for the efﬂux of thiamine [ 29].Molecules 2021 ,26, 5500 8 of 16
Of note, thiamine was also evaluated in a preclinical transporter deﬁcient mice model for
the inhibitory potential of drugs toward OCT1 and OCT2, however, human data for this
hypothesis are not yet available [ 80]. Compared to wild-type mice, levels of endogenous
thiamine were 5.8-fold higher in Oct1/Oct2 double-knockout mice, while renal clear-
ance of high-dose infusion of exogenous thiamine (intended to eliminate effects of renal
reabsorption) was almost 79% lower [ 80].-oxidation and adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase activity were increased in the livers in Oct1(–/–)mice, which could
be indicative of OCT1 involvement in thiamine disposition [ 88]. In wild-type mice, the
MATE inhibitor pyrimethamine reduced urinary excretion of endogenous thiamine by
almost 70% [ 29] and renal clearance of exogenous thiamine by 58% [ 27,80]. The various
transporters involved in the in vivo handling of thiamine suggests its clinical utility as an
endogenous biomarker to mechanistically support for any particular DDI is very limited.
3.2. N1-Methylnicotinamide
N1-Methylnicotinamide (NMN) is produced as a result of tryptophan and niacin
metabolism [ 89], and was previously identiﬁed as a substrate of OCT2 ( Km=300–318 M),
MATE1 ( Km= 301 M), and MATE2K ( Km= 422 M) in overexpressed HEK293 cells or
Xenopus laevis oocytes [ 31,32,90,91]. The uptake of NMN in overexpressed HEK293 cells
was inhibited by pyrimethamine with Ki values of 9.4 M (OCT2), 83 nM (MATE1), and
56 nM (MATE2K) and by trimethoprim with IC 50values of 134 M (OCT2), 29 M (MATE1),
and 0.61 M (MATE2K) as well as by other OCT2/MATE substrates and inhibitors such as
metformin, tetraethyl ammonium (TEA), quinine, and cimetidine [32].
The contribution of transporters to the uptake of NMN is species-dependent [ 31], and
plasma concentrations of NMN follow a circadian rhythm with higher plasma concentra-
tions being observed in the morning and lower concentrations in the evening [ 92]. This
could be a limitation in exploring the utility of NMN as a transporter biomarker, especially
since studies involving the collection of single plasma samples commonly do not take
into account the diurnal changes of NMN levels. Since NMN is not bound to plasma
proteins in humans [ 93], it may be ﬁltered freely in the glomerulus. In humans, NMN
renal clearance is higher than the GFR, suggesting signiﬁcant tubular secretion. Renal
tubular reabsorption seems to also affect the clearance of NMN, in a saturable manner.
Nonetheless, as a potential biomarker for renal OCT2/MATEs, renal clearance of NMN is
of particular interest [84].
NMN has been explored as a potential endogenous OCT2/MATEs transporter bioma-
rker in several human DDI studies [ 31,32]. In a study involving healthy subjects, renal
clearance of NMN was signiﬁcantly reduced in groups treated with pyrimethamine, in
comparison to the control group, to the levels similar to GFR, suggesting that the active
secretion of NMN was completely suppressed by pyrimethamine [ 49]. Other studies in-
volving pyrimethamine and metformin in healthy subjects as a crossover study reported
that NMN renal clearance was reduced in the presence of pyrimethamine in a way compa-
rable to metformin renal clearance [ 31,32,36,94]. A positive correlation between the relative
extent of the effect of trimethoprim on NMN renal clearance correlated positively, and
the effect of trimethoprim on metformin renal clearance was also reported, which adds to
the credibility that NMN serves as a biomarker of renal MATE function [ 31,32]. Although
renal clearance of NMN was reduced, its plasma concentrations were not increased by
pyrimethamine or trimethoprim. This suggests that pyrimethamine and trimethoprim may
affect NMN formation or metabolism through different pathways. It is recommended to
control known confounders such as study design, relevant concomitant medication, and
standardized food and water intake, as well as physical activity, when using NMN for the
assessment of a new molecular entity [84,95].
3.3. N1-Methyladenosine
Metabolomics data using wild-type and Oct1/2 double knockout mice identiﬁed
N1- Methyladenosine (m1A) as a novel OCT2 substrate [ 6].In vitro transport studiesMolecules 2021 ,26, 5500 9 of 16
conﬁrmed that m1A is a substrate of mouse Oct1, Oct2, Mate1, human OCT1, OCT2, and
MATE2-K, but not human MATE1 [ 6]. Urinary excretion is responsible for 77% of the
systemic elimination of m1A in mice and renal clearance of exogenously administered m1A
is decreased in Oct1/2 double knockout or by Mate1 inhibition by pyrimethamine to near
the glomerular ﬁltration rates while plasma concentrations are increased [ 6]. In cynomolgus
monkeys, a single dose of DX-619, an OCT2/MATE2K inhibitor increased the AUC of
m1A (1.72-fold) as well as metformin (2.18-fold) [ 6]. In humans, renal clearance of m1A in
healthy individuals is higher than the GFR, which supports the signiﬁcant contribution of
tubular secretion to urinary excretion. With low diurnal and inter-individual variation in
plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers, m1A could be further explored as a surrogate
probe for the evaluation of DDIs involving OCT2/MATE2K [5].
3.4. Carnitine
Carnitine, and its derivatives acetylcarnitine and propionyl carnitine showed a sub-
stantial and consistent decrease of urinary excretion in both mice and healthy volunteers in
untargeted metabolomics analysis when pyrimethamine was given as a MATE inhibitor. In
healthy volunteers treated with metformin at a micro dose or therapeutic dose, renal clear-
ance of carnitine and acetylcarnitine was decreased by 90–94% and 87–91%, respectively,
when pyrimethamine was co-administered [ 29], and pyrimethamine also reduced carnitine
renal clearance by 62% in mice [ 29]. However, since in vitro studies with HEK293 cells
overexpressing MATE1 or MATE2K did not show an increase in carnitine uptake compared
with control [ 85,91], the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effect of pyrimethamine
on clearance of carnitine and its metabolites remains unclear.
The urinary excretion of both carnitine and acetylcarnitine is reduced in Oct1/Oct2
double-knockout mice in comparison with wild-type mice, and carnitine was found to be
a substrate of OCT2, which suggests the involvement of OCT2 in the renal secretion of
carnitine and possibly acetylcarnitine [ 84]. Nonetheless, in vivo data on this role in humans
is lacking [ 4]. For acylcarnitine, an association with OCTN1, UGT1A1, and carnitine palmi-
toyltransferase 1 genes have been reported and acylcarnitine is also an in vitro substrate of
OCTN2, taken together, these results limit the selectivity of acylcarnitine as a biomarker
for OCT2 [96].
Isobutyryl-carnitine (IBC) has also been recently suggested as a potential OCT1
biomarker from this family, and while genomic data in mouse and humans with active
OCT1 genotypes suggests that is a substrate of OCT1 with carriers of high-activity OCT1
genotypes having almost 3-fold higher IBC concentrations in blood and 2-fold higher in
urine compared to deﬁcient OCT1, more speciﬁc data for IBC are lacking [97,98].
3.5. Creatinine
Creatinine is produced during muscle metabolism and excreted primarily through
glomerular ﬁltration in the kidney. In vitro , creatinine has low afﬁnity as a substrate
of OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K, and OCT3 [ 99–101], and about 10  40% of creatinine is ex-
creted through active tubular secretion in kidneys involving OCT2, OAT2, MATE1, and
MATE2K. Based on in vitro and in vivo studies on correlation analyses of the inhibition of
OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K and clinically observed changes in serum creatinine (SCr) or
creatinine clearance, several compounds were positively predicted to cause OCT2/MATE-
mediated DDIs. However, the changes in serum creatinine associated with OCT2/MATE
interactions are usually not signiﬁcant enough to justify its use as a biomarker. For example,
in the case of cimetidine co-administered with metformin, and ranitidine co-administered
with procainamide or triamterene, interactions were observed with no apparent change
in serum creatinine levels. Furthermore, numerous confounding factors such as weight,
health condition, gender, age, muscle metabolism, and diet affect creatinine clearance,
which collectively limit its use as a biomarker for OCT2/MATE-mediated DDIs [49].Molecules 2021 ,26, 5500 10 of 16
3.6. Others
Dopamine is a MATE substrate. As an in vitro MATE inhibitor, its renal excretion is
reduced in Mate1 knockout mice or with the administration of imatinib [ 40,102]. Dopamine
is also a substrate of OCT2 in vitro [39], but since it is synthesized in renal proximal tubule
cells, the relationship between OCT2 activity and urinary dopamine excretion might be
limited [40]. Human data on dopamine use as a MATE biomarker is lacking.
The amino acid, tryptophan, is an OCT1 and OCT2 substrate, which was identiﬁed
in an untargeted metabolomics analysis of urinary samples of 21 subjects who had partic-
ipated in the clinical trial on metformin pharmacokinetics, in subjects carrying different
functional variants in the OCT2 gene, SLC22A2 [103]. A positive linear association was
previously observed between urinary tryptophan and pharmacokinetic parameters of
metformin, such as renal clearance and renal secretory clearance. In vivo data in humans
and more DDI data on inhibitors are needed to justify the use of tryptophan as a potentially
useful biomarker [49].
4. Conclusions and Future Directions
The family of solute carriers is increasingly recognized as having an important role in
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics proﬁles of many prescription drugs, and as
a site of relevance to DDIs. Mechanistically, most of these DDIs can be linked directly to
effects of a select set of xenobiotic transporters that are critically important in mediating
drug disposition patterns. These transporters include OATPs, OATs, OCTs, and MATEs,
and current regulatory requirements [ 104] propose an integrated approach to assess DDIs
and the potential of a new molecular entity, however, the current in vitro approach is rather
conservative and may result in false-positive prediction and subsequently large number
of traditional clinical DDIs studies using probe drugs. There is a need to an efﬁcient and
cost-effective solution and identify alternative approaches that could help facilitate the
prediction of DDIs in early stages of drug development. Measurement of endogenous
biomarkers could be a practical and affordable approach as a substitute for traditional DDI
studies using probe drugs, especially when clinically efﬁcacious doses are not yet known.
Such potential biomarkers should be thoroughly investigated and validated and
should include considerations related to selectivity and speciﬁcity (determining exactly
which transporters are involved in a biomarker’s distribution), sensitivity (the magnitude
of effect should be signiﬁcant enough to allow differentiation between weak, moderate,
and strong inhibitors), reliability, and reproducibility (the observed change should be
predictive of clinically relevant DDIs, and not due to inter and intra-individual variabilities
due to sex, age, disease state, circadian rhythm, diet or exercise) [ 49,105]. Although many
potential biomarker candidates for transporters have been identiﬁed in recent years using
various approaches and some have even been tested in clinical studies, none have yet
conclusively demonstrated utility as a substitute for clinical DDIs studies. One reason
for this is that most potential biomarkers have not been tested in connection with weak
transporter inhibitors, where anticipated biomarker changes are lower compared with
more sensitive exogenous probe substrates. These considerations demand special attention
to the time course of response of a perpetrator drug on a biomarker to generate reliable
data. The use of a standard cut-off value to determine the change in biomarker exposure
may not be possible to all the tested transporters due to variability in the magnitude of
interaction, instead, a dose dependent increase of exposure of the biomarker in response to
a test inhibitor is recommended as a positive implementation of an interaction with the
transporter of interest. Another reason might be the relatively low selectivity/speciﬁcity of
presently identiﬁed endogenous biomarkers. A better mechanistic understanding of the
formation, disposition, and elimination of the biomarker, such as contribution of genetic
polymorphisms to the biomarker disposition, would greatly facilitate interpretation of the
biomarker DDIs data.
One particularly fruitful area of research that could help resolve the above problems
is related to the implementation of a bottom-to-top approach that involves the selec-Molecules 2021 ,26, 5500 11 of 16
tion of endogenous transporter substrates from untargeted metabolomics approaches in
transporter-deﬁcient and humanized transgenic mice in the presence and absence of spe-
ciﬁc inhibitors. This would allow for the identiﬁcation of putative biomarkers in a more
unbiased manner that does not depend on top-to-bottom strategies that are initiated by
observations in human subjects where the likelihood of identifying selective and speciﬁc
biomarkers is intrinsically compromised. In such bottom-up approaches, substrates with
the most robust differences can be more easily identiﬁed and subsequently used to ensure
that a sufﬁcient degree of sensitivity is achieved. Another useful tool that requires further
investigation is the application of endogenous biomarker cocktails to highlight the indi-
vidual and collective importance of multiple transporters simultaneously in the context
of DDIs prediction [ 49]. Careful consideration of clinical trial design is also required in
order to ensure sufﬁcient reliability of the generated data and, generally, studies should
be designed in a manner that minimizes confounding factors and increases statistical
power, for example by employing randomized crossover designs. Unfortunately, many
biomarker-driven clinical DDIs studies published to date suffer from small sample sizes in
relation to anticipated or observed effect sizes, as well as from a host of other potentially
confounding factors that may have inﬂuenced their outcome. Most important among these
are (unknown) environmental variables and physiologic factors that may affect expression
of the transporters of interest, the use of healthy volunteers that may not adequately repre-
sent the target population of patients, and confounding links to other transporter genes or
variants of putative relevance to drug disposition pathways.
Although the use of cocktail strategies together with multiple biomarkers opposed to
testing single biomarkers to predict certain DDIs has been proposed and may have clinical
importance, this remains to be clariﬁed for most perpetrator drugs. In addition, more
detailed investigations into the inﬂuence of ethnicity and racial ancestry on the functional
utility of particular transporter biomarkers, and on the basal function and expression of
relevant transporters, is urgently required. Despite these reservations, it is anticipated
that, over the next decade, the importance of transporter biomarkers and their role in
DDI prediction will be more clearly deﬁned, and that continued investigation in this area
will likely have a profound impact on attempts to reﬁne treatment regimens involving
polypharmacy with transporter substrates.
