ABSTRACT
Introduction: Drug interactions are one of the major contributors to increase hospital stay, inflate 
health care expenses, and cause serious adverse events and end-organ damage. Patients admitted to 
the intensive care unit are already critically sick and are at greater risk of these adverse outcomes. 
The study aimed to find out the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions in the intensive care 
units of a tertiary care centre. 
Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the patients admitted in the 
intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital from April-June 2019. Ethical approval was taken from 
the Institutional Review Board at the institute (Reference number: 399). Convenience sampling 
method was used. Data was collected using proforma and potential drug-drug interactions were 
identified using Lexicomp® drug-interactions version 1.1 (Wolters Kluwer). All the drug interactions 
identified were classified and the severity scale of interactions was also defined. Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences version 17.0 was used for data analysis. Point estimate at 95% Confidence 
Interval was calculated along with frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and mode.   
Results: Out of 101 patients, the prevalence of the drug-drug interaction was found to be 90 (89.11%) 
(83.04-95.18 at 95% Confidence Interval). A total of 490 drug-drug interactions were identified. In 
severity scale, it was seen that 311 (63.46%) were of moderate severity and 303 (61.83%) of drug 
interactions were categorised as category C in risk rating. 
Conclusions: Prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions was higher compared to similar 
published literature. The most common drug with potential interaction was fentanyl and among 
pairs was fentanyl plus paracetamol.

INTRODUCTION 
Alteration in the efficacy or toxicity of one drug due to 
the presence of another simultaneously administered 
drug is termed as drug-drug interactions (DDI).1 The 
prevalence of DDI is reported to be 3-5% in patients 
who receive 3-10 drugs and increases to 20% when 
they are given 10-20 drugs.2 Factors like polypharmacy 
(four or more drugs), pharmacological properties 
of medicines, elderly patients having comorbidities predisposed to the development of DDIs.3-5 DDIs are 
known to increase hospital stay, inflate health care 
expenses, and cause serious adverse events.JNMA I VOL 60 I ISSUE 247I MARCH 2022264

have multiple co-morbidities and are being managed 
with polypharmacy. So, there is always a substantial 
risk of potential drug-drug interaction (pDDI) in the ICU 
setting. Data from our own country shows that 57.7% 
of ICU admitted patients experienced at least one DDI 
in one of the teaching hospitals in Nepal.6 
The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of 
potential DDIs in ICU patients of a tertiary care centre.
METHODS
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted 
among the patients admitted in the ICU of Tribhuvan 
University Teaching Hospital, Institute of Medicine. 
Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional 
Review Committee of Institute of Medicine (Reference 
number: 399). All the patients who were prescribed 
more than two drugs admitted in the ICU for more 
than 24 hours between April-June 2019 were included 
in the study. Consent was obtained from the patient’s 
relative who had consented during hospital admission. 
However, patients admitted in ICU for less than 24 
hours, receiving topical drugs (ointments, creams, 
eye drops, or ear drops), nutritional supplements, and 
vitamins only, and those patients whose prescription 
was less than two drugs were excluded. A convenience 
sampling method was used.
The sample size was calculated using the following 
formula:
n= (Z2 x p x q) / e2 
  = (1.962 x 0.5 x 0.5) / 0.12
  = 97
Where,
n= minimum required sample size
Z= 1.96 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI)
p= prevalence of pDDI taken as 50% for maximum 
      sample size
q= 1-p
e= margin of error, 10%
Patients’ cardex were reviewed on a daily basis till 
the discharge from ICU and data was collected in 
the proforma sheet that included demographic data 
of patient and the drugs given to the patient. The 
enlisted drugs were assessed for pDDIs which was 
identified by the Lexicomp® drug-interactions version 
1.1 (Wolters Kluwer). Their risk rating was classified 
into five categories.7 The identified pDDIs were also 
classified according to the severity.6 
Collected data was coded and entered in Microsoft 
Excel and was analysed using Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0. Point estimate 
at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with 
frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation and 
mode.RESULTS
Out of 101 patients admitted to ICU, the prevalence 
of potential drug-drug interaction was found in 90 
(89.11%) patients (83.04-95.18 at 95% Confidence 
Interval). The total number of drugs prescribed was 
816 and the mean number of drugs prescribed per 
prescription was found to be 8.08±3.7 (range 3-25). 
Fentanyl was found to be the most common drug 
accounted for 238 (29.28%) followed by phenytoin 
which was 124 (25.30%) responsible for pDDIs. When 
drugs were classified according to Anatomical and 
Therapeutic Category (ATC), it was seen that nervous 
system drugs (ATC class N) were the most common 
drugs which was 501 (51.1%) among the observed 
pDDIs, followed by anti-infective drugs (ATC class J) 
141 (14.4%).
The mean number of pDDI per prescription was found 
to be 4.85±4.56. In 36 (40%) patients, there were more 
than five pDDIs. A total number of 490 pDDIs were 
identified. On severity rating, it was seen that 311 
(63.46%) pDDIs identified were of moderate severity. 
On categorising the pDDIs according to risk rating, it 
was seen that 303 (61.83%) fell into category C. The 
pDDIs that were classified as category X was found to 
be 10 (2.04%) (Table 1).

paracetamol and fentanyl 44 (8.98%) with risk rating 
B and minor severity. The second most common drug 
pair causing pDDI was fentanyl and phenytoin and fell 
under risk rating C with moderate severity (Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated a prevalence of 89.11% of 
pDDI. Similar prevalence of pDDI was reported by a 
study conducted in ICUs of public and private hospitals 
in Brazil.8 However, the study conducted by another 
study in a public hospital in Brazil reported that 22% 
of ICU prescriptions studied had 787 identified DDIs.9 
Another study from India conducted in geriatric 
patients admitted in ICU reported prevalence of pDDI 
to be 83.25%.1 Studies with lower rates (72.5%) of 
prevalence of pDDIs are also present.10 A study from 
a medical college of Pokhara, Nepal reported 15 out of 
26 patients admitted in their ICU to have encountered 
at least one pDDI.6 
Several factors could have contributed to the high 
prevalence of pDDI seen in our study. The factors 
could be drug related or patient related. Patients in 
ICU are critically ill and have derangements in their 
physiological state due to multiple health issues. 
This leads to complex pharmacotherapy being 
instituted in them that involves use of multiple drugs 
(polypharmacy). Thus, these patients are predisposed 
to witness higher pDDIs as compared to patients in 
other settings. The prevalence of pDDIs in this study 
was significantly correlated with the numbers of drugs 
administered. A study reported that frequency of 
pDDIs were significantly correlated with the number  
of medications prescribed. Additionally, the study also 
reported correlation of pDDI with factors like age and 
number of co-morbidities of the patient.1 A study from 
Brazil has reported that the number of DDI is positively 
correlated with duration of hospital stay, irrespective 
of the number of prescribed drugs and procedures 
performed in the patients from ICU of a general 
hospital.9 
The potential drug-drug interactions detected were 
mostly moderate to severe. The clinical evidence of Ghimire et al. Potential Drug-drug Interaction among the Patients Admitted in Intensive Care Units of a Tertiary Care Centre: A Descriptive...
a drug interaction is determined by the severity.11,12 
The pDDIs encountered in a study conducted in Nepal 
reported 72.23% of pDDIs as of moderate severity 
according to the Micromedex electronic database 
system.6 A study from Brazil had reported 27.13% of 
pDDIs to be highly significant, ones with either severe 
or moderate intensity and with either established or 
probable evidence.8 Though there were smaller number 
of minor pDDIs seen in our study, the interactions 
could be clinically relevant due to the clinical condition 
of the ICU patients as suggested by other authors.8 The 
higher prevalence of moderate pDDIs seen in our study 
is concerning and needs to be addressed. Several 
interventions like Continuing Medical Education 
targeting physicians and nurses, drug bulletins, 
audits, etc. could help to create awareness among the 
physicians to avoid them in future. The involvement 
of expertise like Clinical Pharmacologists in the team 
to share the responsibility of patient care could also 
help to minimise pDDIs. Availability of a reliable drug 
interaction checker software at the point of care could 
also help minimise the prevalence of pDDIs.
When the drugs implicated to cause pDDIs were 
classified according to ATC classification, it was 
seen that the drugs acting on the nervous system 
were most commonly associated with pDDIs 
(51.1%). Fentanyl was the most common drug with 
a high probability of causing pDDI in our study. A 
Brazilian study similarly reported 40% of pDDIs being 
associated with drugs acting in the central nervous 
system and also reported midazolam (20.8%) to be the 
most common drug associated with pDDIs followed 
by fentanyl (6.7%) and both drugs were combinedly 
associated with 45 (14.5%) of pDDIs identified in the 
study.10 Pain is a common complaint of the patients 
admitted in ICU which could be due to the morbidity 
as well as iatrogenic (associated with the procedures). 
It is recommended that procedural pain in adult ICU 
patients is managed appropriately using opioids like 
fentanyl along with other pharmacological and non-
pharmacological modalities.13 
Fentanyl-paracetamol pair was the most common 
drug pair causing DDI followed by fentanyl-phenytoin 
pair. According to the output of software used to 
check the potential pDDIs in this study, fentanyl may 
decrease the absorption of paracetamol. However, the 
extent to which the systemic exposure of paracetamol 
is decreased is uncertain. The severity rating of this 
potential pDDIs is minor and the risk rating is B. 
Phenytoin is an enzyme inducer and increases the 
activity of CYP450 3A4, an enzyme involved in 
metabolising  fentanyl. Thus, a patient receiving these 
agents concomitantly might experience reduced 
efficacy of fentanyl or may experience withdrawal JNMA I VOL 60 I ISSUE 247I MARCH 2022266

drug-drug pairs as the most common contributor of 
pDDI. A study from Nepal conducted in ICU patients 
identified aspirin-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors as the most common drug interaction pair in 
their study.6 Another study conducted in 2008 reported 
that captopril-spironolactone pair was the most frequent 
(27 prescriptions) implicated to cause highly significant 
pDDIs in their ICU patients.8 In another study from 
Brazil, it was seen that there were 64 distinct pair of 
drugs causing DDIs and among them insulin-aspirin pair 
was the most commonly implicated to cause DDIs (106 
pDDIs) in the ICU patients at that general hospital.9 
The difference in pattern of pDDIs could have been due 
to variation in admission diagnosis, availability of the 
drugs, and the P-drug of the treating physicians. There 
were seven drug pairs in our study contributing to ten 
pDDIs (2%) in our study that was categorised as “X” in 
risk rating. Similar proportion of category X pDDI was 
reported by Shetty V, et.al. who found 14 drug pairs 
contributing to 20 DDIs (3.02%) belonging to category 
X.1 In our study, quetiapine-metoclopramide pair was 
the most common cause of category X pDDIs. Both the 
drugs are known to increase antidopaminergic effects 
and may lead to development of extrapyramidal effects 
and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study done in a 
single tertiary care centre.In the current study, though, occurrence of pDDIs was not monitored clinically. 
Duration of hospital stay was also not calculated. The 
small-time frame also excluded the chances of patients 
with large varieties of comorbidities to be included. 
The software used for identification of drug interaction 
has sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 90%. The 
positive and negative predictive values of the software 
are similarly 90% and 97% respectively. The software 
additionally does not take into consideration the dose 
of the medicines while assessing the drug-pairs for 
drug interactions.14
CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions was 
high as compared to findings from similar reported 
literature. The potential drug interactions identified 
were of moderate severity. The most common drug 
to have potential drug interaction was fentanyl and 
the medication pair was fentanyl plus paracetamol. A 
small percentage of drug interactions belonged to the 
risk category X. The outcomes of this study will aid in 
raising awareness of pDDIs in ICU.
