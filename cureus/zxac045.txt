override rates, alert fatigue, and ultimately patient harm. Drug-drug inter -
action (DDI) alerts often fail to account for factors that could reduce risk; 
further, drugs that trigger alerts are often inconsistently grouped into value 
sets. Toward improving the specificity of DDI alerts, the objectives of this 
study were to (1) highlight the inconsistency of drug value sets for trigger -
ing DDI alerts and (2) demonstrate a method of classifying factors that can 
be used to modify the risk of harm from a DDI.
Methods. This was a proof-of-concept study focused on 15 well-known 
DDIs. Using 3 drug interaction references, we extracted 2 drug value sets 
and any available order- and patient-related factors for each DDI. Fleiss’ 
kappa was used to measure the consistency of value sets among refer -
ences. Risk-modifying factors were classified as order parameters (eg, 
route and dose) or patient characteristics (eg, comorbidities and labora-
tory results).
results. Seventeen value sets (56%) had nonsignificant agreement. 
Agreement among the remaining 13 value sets was on average moder -
ate. Thirty-three factors that could reduce risk in 14 of 15 DDIs (93%) 
were identified. Most risk-modifying factors (67%) were classified as order 
parameters.
conclusion. This study demonstrates the importance of increasing the 
consistency of drug value sets that trigger DDI alerts and how alert speci-
ficity and usefulness can be improved with risk-modifying factors obtained 
from drug references. It may be difficult to operationalize certain factors to 
reduce unnecessary alerts; however, factors can be used to support deci-
sions by providing contextual information.

Clinical decision support (CDS) has 
the potential to prevent harmful 
drug-drug interactions (DDIs); how -
ever, greater than 90% of DDI alerts are 
overridden (ie, ignored or dismissed).1 
Despite clinicians deeming most DDI 
alerts as “not clinically significant, ” 
more than half of alert overrides are in -
appropriate.2,3 Inappropriate overrides 
result in approximately 6 times more 
adverse drug events compared to appro -
priate overrides.4 Numerous irrelevant 
DDI alerts can desensitize clinicians, 
whereby important patient safety alerts are overridden, a phenomenon called 
alert fatigue.5 Excessive override rates 
and ubiquitous adverse drug events are 
evidence that conventional medica -
tion alerts are not meeting clinician in -
formation needs or CDS implementer 
expectations.6-9
Conventional DDI alerts are trig-
gered or invoked by the presence of 
2 interacting drugs. While increasing 
alert specificity or usefulness is possible 
by incorporating patient factors (eg, 
comorbidities and laboratory results) 
and drug order factors (eg, route and Improving the specificity of drug-drug interaction alerts:

IMPROVING SPECIFICITY OF DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION ALERTS
dose) in CDS logic,10,11 alerts largely 
do not account for contextual factors 
that can eliminate the need of an alert 
or affect the risk of certain DDIs.12 For 
instance, a drug interaction between 
the HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor 
atorvastatin and the protease inhibitor 
fosamprenavir may not be clinically 
significant if the dose of atorvastatin 
is below 20 mg per day. In addition to 
the lack of contextual factors in CDS 
logic, triggering of DDI alerts depends 
on 2 separate drug groups (ie, value 
sets).13 Value sets have been charac -
terized as lists of codes and terms that 
define a clinical concept.14 Drug know-
ledge bases frequently define inter -
actions in terms of value sets based on 
certain criteria, such as mechanism of 
action for a monoamine oxidase in-
hibitor (MAOI) value set. Evidence for 
a drug interaction is often limited to a 
few drugs in a value set,15 with the po-
tential for an interaction inferred to 
additional drugs.16 Generalizing evi-
dence to members of a drug class is 
an unstandardized approach that can 
lead to variation among value sets that 
trigger DDI alerts, resulting in reduced 
CDS effectiveness and inconsistent 
outcomes across institutions.17 For ex -
ample, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin, 
which would both be included in an 
HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor value 
set, are metabolized by the cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 2C9 isozyme and will likely 
not be clinically relevant to an inter -
action between an HMG Co-A reduc -
tase inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
While CDS implementors have some 
ability to control CDS logic and value 
sets, institutions often rely on third-
party systems and drug information 
knowledge bases (eg, MedKnowledge 
[First DataBank, Inc.], Multum [Cerner 
Corporation], and Medi-Span [Wolters 
Kluwer Health]) to generate DDI alerts.6
CDS implementers have em-
ployed multiple strategies to im-
prove DDI alerts. Individual alert 
override rates have been used to 
identify and filter irrelevant or inef -
fective alerts.18 Another strategy is to 
create a list of low-priority DDIs and 
downgrade alerts to noninterruptive mechanisms.15 Additionally, severity 
thresholds have been increased so that 
only high-priority alerts are shown 
to clinicians.15,19 While the process by 
which drug alerts are filtered or modi-
fied is often accomplished with user 
consensus,20-24 certain institutions 
do not have the ability to customize 
CDS logic or do not have access to 
terminologists and subject matter ex -
pertise to create and maintain value 
sets25,26; therefore, these approaches to 
improving DDI alerts are less explored. 
Toward understanding the need for 
curated value sets and how contextual 
factors can be used to increase the spe-
cificity and usefulness of DDI alerts, 
the objectives of this study were to (1) 
highlight the inconsistency of drug 
value sets for triggering DDI alerts and 
(2) demonstrate a method of classifying 
factors that can be used to modify the 
risk of harm from a DDI.
Methods
As a proof-of-concept study, we fo-
cused on 15 high-priority DDIs iden-
tified by the Office of the National 
Coordinator (ONC) for Health 
Information Technology ( Table 1).27 
We analyzed DDI information in 3 references: Lexicomp (UpToDate, 
Inc.), Micromedex (IBM Corporation), 
and Hansten and Horn’s The Top 100 
Drug Interactions.27 Drugs in each 
interacting value set and factors that 
can affect the risk or severity of the DDI 
were extracted. Drug interaction refer -
ences provide a list of drug names (ie, 
value sets) for each DDI (ie, drug A and 
drug B), and we mapped DDIs among 
references to the ONC list. As such, 
for value sets with a single drug A (eg, 
atazanavir), multiple interacting drugs 
were often listed in each reference. 
The appendix provides a complete list 
of drugs for each value set across ref -
erences. Contextual factors were ex -
tracted from the narrative monograph 
and classified as either order param-
eters or patient characteristics.
Drugs.   Items on the ONC list 
of high-priority DDIs were defined 
in terms of individual drugs (eg, 
irinotecan), drug classes (eg, se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), 
or mechanism of action (eg, strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors).28 We measured 
the consistency of drugs in each value 
set among the ONC list and the 3 drug 
interaction references. The value set 
consistency was calculated using Fleiss’ 
kappa, which is used for measuring 
nominal scale agreement among many 
raters or, for the purpose of this analysis, 
drug interaction references. Measure 
categories were as follows: almost per -
fect (0.81-1.00), substantial (0.61-0.80), 
moderate (0.41-0.60), fair (0.21-0.40), 
and slight (0.0-0.2).29,30 We chose Fleiss’ 
kappa due to familiarity with Cohen’s 
kappa, a method to measure agreement 
between 2 raters.
Factors.   Drug monographs for 
each DDI combination were manu-
ally extracted from the 3 references. 
Factors that affect DDI risk or se-
verity were annotated by a single au-
thor (T.R.) with pharmacotherapy and 
DDI experience. Factor categories 
were initially derived iteratively with 
a bottom-up approach across the ex -
tracted monographs. Collation of de-
rived categories aligned with the Fast 
Healthcare Interoperability Resources 
(FHIR) standard (Health Level Seven KeY PoiNts
 • Consistency of drugs among 
drug interactions value sets is 
limited.
 • Incorporating contextual fac -
tors, such as patient charac -
teristics and order parameters, 
may improve drug interaction 
alerts.
 • The findings suggest that a 
central authority and new 
technology may be needed to 
maintain drug value sets and 
that expanding clinical decision 
support logic to include con -
textual factors will be crucial to 
improving drug interaction alert 
specificity.

all FHIR resources discussed here are 
trademarked by HL7).31 A second clin-
ician with DDI and data standards ex -
pertise (A.R.) reviewed the resulting 
resources and categories. Factors in the 
extracted monographs were first an-
notated according to order or patient 
categories. Then, order and patient fac -
tors were classified as timing, dose, and 
route and as condition, observation, 
and medication, respectively.
Fhir resources.  Medication-
Request is a FHIR resource that is 
used for inpatient and outpatient set -
tings to order or request medications. 
The resource includes elements for 
timing, dose, and route of medica-
tion orders. Three FHIR “event” re-
sources (Condition, Observation, and 
Medication) relate to patient character -
istics. Timing factors are relevant when 
time between the administration of 2 
interacting drugs can modify the risk of 
DDI occurrence. Dose factors are rele-
vant when the dose of either interacting 
drug affects the potential DDI harm severity. Route of administration is im-
portant when the route can modify the 
risk of a DDI, such as lack of systemic 
absorption from topical, ophthalmic, 
or otic agents. Condition factors in-
clude patient comorbidities and acute 
problems that may affect the severity 
of DDIs. Observation factors are any 
relevant measurements (eg, laboratory 
test results and vital signs) that modify 
the risk or severity of a DDI. Medication 
factors include other medications the 
patient is taking that may increase or 
decrease the severity or risk of a DDI, 
as well as medications in a specific 
value set that pose less or more inter -
action risk. We tracked the number of 
drug interaction references that pro-
vided a similar factor in the DDI mono-
graph. Table 2 provides an example of 
the monograph and annotations for the 
SSRIs/MAOIs DDI.
results
Overall, the 15 high-priority DDIs 
on the ONC list were identified in 
the 3 drug interaction references. A  discrepancy was that one refer -
ence separated the Tranylcypromine/
Procarbazine and Triptans/MAOI DDIs 
into separate value sets. For instance, 
certain triptans were included in the 
broader serotonergic value set. For 
these DDIs, the consistency was cal-
culated among the 2 other drug refer -
ences and the ONC list.
Drugs.  The 15 DDIs encompassed 
30 drug value sets and 682 drugs. The 
mean number of drugs per value set 
was 23 (median, 13). Of the 23-drug 
average per value set, an average of 
3.8 drugs were the same across refer -
ences (Figure 1). Table 3 provides the 
total number of drugs in each value 
set, the calculated value set agreement, 
and a listing of drugs in value sets for 
which there was perfect consensus 
among references. For instance, the 
Amphetamine & Derivatives value set 
included 17 unique drugs and had a sig-
nificant Fleiss’ kappa of 0.16 (P = 0.04); 
amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, 
lisdexamfetamine, and metham-
phetamine were identified in the 
ONC list and the 3 drug interaction 
references. Seventeen value sets 
(56%) had nonsignificant agree-
ment across the drug interaction ref -
erences. Further, of the significant 
value sets, the average Fleiss’ kappa 
was moderate (0.45; standard devi-
ation [SD], 0.33). Value sets with per -
fect agreement (Fleiss’ kappa  =  1) 
included Irinotecan, Tizanidine, and 
Azathioprine & Mercaptopurine. 
Two value sets had moderate agree-
ment (Febuxostat, P  =  0.03; and PPIs, 
P  <  0.001), 4 had fair agreement  
(MAOIs [ Table 3, DDI  1], P   =  0.006; 
MAOIs [ Table 3, DDI 4], P  = 0.006; MAOIs 
[Table 3, DDI 7], P  = 0.001; and Protease 
Inhibitors, P  <  0.001), and 4 had slight 
agreement (Amphetamine & Derivatives, 
P = 0.04; SSRIs, P  = 0.008; strong CYP1A2 
Inhibitors, P = 0.002; and MAOIs [ Table 3,  
DDI 6], P = 0.02).
Factors.   From 14 of the 15 DDIs 
(93%), a total of 33 contextual factors 
were extracted ( Table 4). The DDI with 
no identified factors was CYP3A4  & 
Protease Inhibitors/Ergot Alkaloids.

order related, with timing factors 
extracted for 10 of 15 DDIs (67%). 
Furthermore, timing factors were con-
sistent across references (ie, 3 of 3 or 2 
of 2 sources were in agreement) for 8 
of the 10 DDIs (80%). Most timing fac -
tors were associated with MAOIs; the 
references provided recommendations 
to wait at least 14  days after stopping 
an MAOI before starting an interacting 
medication. Dose factors were available 
for 9 DDIs (60%). Compared to timing, dose factors were less consistent across 
the references. Two of the 9 DDIs (22%) 
had dose considerations that were con-
sistent across the references. Most dose 
recommendations were nonspecific in-
creases or decreases when initiating a 
medication that changes metabolism. 
Route of administration factors were 
identified for 3 of 15 DDIs (20%). The 
route factors were specific to the trans -
dermal administration of the MAOI 
selegiline.
Patient factors were available with 
9 DDIs (60%). Most medication fac -
tors were specific drug exclusions from 
the value set due to low risk of the 
interaction. High-risk QT-prolonging 
agents had patient considerations in 
all 3 categories; however, only the con-
dition factor (eg, comorbidities) was 
consistent across all 3 drug interaction 
references. The condition factor for the 
Atazanavir/PPIs DDI included treat -
ment experience (ie, atazanavir treat -
ment experienced vs naïve), age, sex, 
and heart disease. Observation factors included laboratory measures (eg, 
hypokalemia). The medication factor 
for High-Risk QT Prolonging Agents 
was related to CYP3A4 substrates. 
These substrates increase the blood 
concentration of certain QT-prolonging 
agents and was an additive risk for pro-
longing heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) 
intervals.
Discussion
This study demonstrates the im-
portance of increasing the consist -
ency of drug value sets that trigger 
DDI alerts and how alert specificity 
and usefulness can be improved with 
risk-modifying factors. Despite the rec -
ognition and familiarity of the chosen 
DDIs, it was surprising that less than 
half (43%) of the 30 drug value sets had 
a significant consistency among drug 
references and that the average agree-
ment was moderate ( Table 3). Further, 
most DDIs (93%) had at least 1 poten-
tial risk-modifying factor and several 
(40%) had more than 2 factors ( Table 4). Figure 1. Depiction of value set in -

IMPROVING SPECIFICITY OF DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION ALERTS
Incorporating contextual factors in CDS 
logic can not only improve the specifi-
city of alerts but also make alerts more 
useful by providing contextual infor -
mation about DDI risk factors. A  feas -
ible approach to address risk-modifying 
factors and curated value sets may be through emerging health information 
technology standards such as HL7’s 
FHIR, Clinical Quality Language (CQL), 
and CDS Hooks.32-36 CDS implementers 
can use these standards and web-based 
technology to bridge limited electronic 
health record functionality with CDS logic that incorporates contextual fac -

agreement of drug pairs across 3 drug 
knowledge bases (ie, First DataBank, 
Micromedex, and Multum) that are 
used to generate CDS alerts. Among 8.6 
million unique drug pairs, only 5% of 
them were found in all the 3 knowledge 
bases. Cornu et  al37 found that while 
high-priority DDI alerts were gener -
ally available across knowledge bases, 
severity levels (eg, “moderate” and 
“severe”) varied considerably. Severity 
levels contribute to whether certain 
alerts are active and the type of alert 
that was shown to clinicians.22 Often 
severity levels are preset by knowledge 
vendors, but healthcare institutions 
can modify these settings. Our ana-

ically relevant.

istics, there are caveats to operational-
izing contextual factors with DDI alerts. 
Not all DDIs are amenable to modifying 
factors. Certain DDIs pose the same 
risk across patients and medication 
order parameters. Empiric evidence 
of DDIs is limited. The evaluated DDIs 
were not selected based on the po-
tential for factors to modify the risk or severity of the DDI. Other DDIs may 
be more or less amenable to increasing 
alert specificity. Further, most factors 
we identified were nonspecific con-
ditions or exposure thresholds. These 
factors may not be granular enough to 
filter DDI alerts; however, the factors 
may be useful for clinicians to deter -
mine DDI risk. For example, heart dis -
ease is specified as a patient factor for 
QTc-prolonging interactions. Would 
this factor be operationalized as heart 
failure, atrial fibrillation, or a previous 
myocardial infarction? Or perhaps all 
three? It is unclear how this factor could 
be used to filter an alert, but it could 
be used to present patient-specific in-
formation to clinicians. Finally, DDI Table 4. Order and Patient Factors by Potential DDI Across Drug Interaction Databasesa

IMPROVING SPECIFICITY OF DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION ALERTS
contextual factors lack a standardized 
taxonomy to support implementation 
in CDS logic.
Limitations.   This study has limi-
tations. The selected DDIs, while iden-
tified as high-priority DDIs by ONC, 
may not be representative of DDIs 
across institutions. Additionally, we 
did not search for contextual factors 
in drug knowledge bases that are used 
for electronic health record alerts, as 
these knowledge bases are not easily 
referenceable. Finally, we did not 
empirically test how factors and cur -
ated value sets would increase alert 
specificity.
conclusion
The goal of this proof-of-concept 
analysis was to better understand the 
need for curated value sets that are 
used in triggering DDI alerts and dem-
onstrate how contextual factors can be 
used to increase the specificity and use-
fulness of DDI alerts. The findings high-
light that the consistency of drug value 
sets is limited for a list of well-known 
DDIs. Encouraging, however, was the 
potential to use contextual factors in 
CDS logic. While many identified fac -
tors may not provide granular informa-
tion to eliminate certain DDI alerts, the 
factors can provide useful information 
for clinicians to decide whether to over -
ride an alert. These findings can gener -
alize to other DDIs, suggesting that a 
central authority and new technology 
may be needed to maintain drug value 
sets and that expanding CDS logic 
will be crucial to improve DDI alert 
specificity.
